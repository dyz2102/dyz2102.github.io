            <p>Sometimes, one gets lucky in life.</p>
<p>So I met my hero two nights ago at the Sina 2010 Internet Celebration (<strong><a href="http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/netchina2010/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="external">新浪2010·网络盛典</a></strong>). There were lots of big-name people there, and it really convinced me of 1<strong>. Sina’s dominant power in China’s media sphere </strong>and<strong> 2. The future market of the micro-blogging sector in China.</strong> This event was able to attract many celebrities, many of whom you can find at the link above, but it was also able to attract the some of the most prominent business figures in China today: <strong>任志强，潘石屹，李开复，曹国伟，周忻，张亚勤，冯军</strong>，etc.</p>
<p>I was, and by no means I’m I trying to exaggerate, <em>starstruck</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[caption id=”attachment_191” align=”aligncenter” width=”614” caption=”Meeting my hero Jack Ma”]<a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/258.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/258.jpg?w=1024" alt="" title="With Jack Ma"></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>I think of all businessmen in China, I wanted to meet Jack Ma the most. He is to me beyond a businessman, celebrity, CEO, founder, or anything else that you can put a tangible name on. He embodies an era that is going through China’s rapidly-growing economy and a culture that is being pioneered in China at this very moment - the culture of entrepreneurship and innovation.</p>
<p>Words can’t describe how excited I was when I shook his hand and told him about GCC and the work that we are doing. I of course extended a friendly invite for his son, who now attends my high school, to join GCC when he begins his studies in college. I told him about how we attended the Alifest this year and our great meeting with Ambassador Huntsman. He nodded and smiled haha. I like Jack, and will probably continue to like and respect him for as long as Alibaba continues to make meaningful contribution to the Chinese society.</p>
<p>I was not there to take pictures with as many famous people as I can so, here ends my sharing of photos with me in it. But below are some interesting photos I thought might catch one’s sight:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[caption id=”attachment_194” align=”aligncenter” width=”614” caption=”任志强和潘石屹“纺织围脖””]<a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/p1140804.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/p1140804.jpg?w=1024" alt="" title="任志强和潘石屹“纺织围脖”"></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[caption id=”attachment_193” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”方文山上台颁奖”]<a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/p1140792.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/p1140792.jpg" alt="" title="方文山上台颁奖"></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in the end I saw 方文山 haha.</p>
<p>This was great. A night I will remember forever :-).</p>

            <p>Update 4:38pm -</p>
<p>Today was a tough day. But in the end, I believe I came out victorious. Because on my passport now is a multi-entry visa to PRC for the next - wait for it… TWO YEARS!</p>
<p>Can’t get that in Hong Kong. Or many other places. Not on the same day anyway.</p>
<p>What this means is no more visa issues for the next 730 days. That’s 17,520 hours or about one million minutes. That’s how long I will NOT have to think about the word “visa” again.</p>
<p>Good-bye Malaysia, maybe it ain’t so bad here after all. At least you took care of my visa =).</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Update 1:04pm -</p>
<p>I did mention it was war… and I didn’t give up that easy. Found a ticket on AirAsia.com for 8:30pm. Flying to Guangzhou for the night and taking the first flight tomorrow morning to Sanya. Missing out tonight, but catching most of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Let me out of KL!!!</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Update 12:15pm -</p>
<p>I might’ve been a little too happy little too early. Turns out there are no flights from Kuala Lumpur to Sanya (to Guangzhou actually, for transit) after 2:10pm. When I pick up my passport at 3:30pm the flight will be hovering over Hainan, looking down at Sanya, ridiculing my stupidity. The flight still has to land in Guangzhou before another flight takes over to fly to Sanya.</p>
<p>Sanya - you suck. Why do no one want to fly to you? Must not be very popular.</p>
<p>So yah. I am stuck in Malaysia. The war has been fought and lost. Booking a hotel now and flights for tomorrow. I miss non-traveling.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Update 11:08am -</p>
<p>Successfully submitted my application in time for Rush Service! The process was quite painful. A bit of sharing here for any of you who might run into this problem down the line. So I just walked in there with my passport and basically nothing else. I had to get my photos taken, cost 16 ringgit (about 40RMB), then photocopy the picture page of my passport as well as the page with the Malaysian entry stamp - 40 sen (cents) for the two pages. There was no line. It’s a big air-conditioned room with very few people in there. I guess Malaysians all got their multi-entry visa already and aren’t really thinking about getting new ones in early January. Most of the workers are Malaysians who speak Chinese. I was quick. Like all other consulates you pay when you pick-up the visa. Mine’s supposed to be done at 3:30pm (they close at 4:00pm). Keeping my fingers crossed that this is happening.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>So I was playing clever and tricked myself into thinking that I can magically get a Chinese visa when I land in Sanya around 5:30pm today. Wrong. All flights from Kuala Lumpur to Sanya must transfer through Guangzhou, and you get out of the boarder in Guangzhou - and there is no visa for you, or your fellow travelers, or anybody else, waiting in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>So I’m now on the KLIA Ekspress (Kuala Lumpur International Airport “Express”) heading back into the city to the Chinese embassy to get my visa. The website says that “rushed service” is available and you can obtain your visa in the afternoon on the same day, provided that you submit the application sufficiently early. Today is Friday - so if I miss this, I am stuck here for the weekend. Wasted my hotel fees in Sanya and have to pay more for the hotel here in KL. Can’t meet up with the four friends I planned to meet with in Sanya at this event I’ve been so excited about. Three giant capital letters hover above my head as I type away here on this air-conditioned, internet-infused, bad-music-playing train. The first letter comes immediately after E, the second after L, and the third one after K.</p>
<p>Does this justify my escapist longing for Beijing right now? … Probably yes.</p>
<p>This reminds me of my last trip in HK where I also almost didn’t get a visa in time to return to China - well, this time because my passport pages were running out and the 中国旅行社 won’t submit my visa for me. I went to the consulate myself and nobody said anything about the fact that I had only one page left in my passport. This experience of course prompted me to get a new passport with twice as many pages as my previous one (who’d known in 2008 that I’d be traveling so much?).</p>
<p>Alrighties, train rolling into the city. Updates coming. Wish me luck. Fingers crossed.</p>

            <p>From Dec. 27<sup>th</sup> – Dec. 30<sup>th </sup>began my first few days of a winter travel plan that will conclude on Jan. 11<sup>th</sup> when I return to Beijing.</p>
<p>Flew down from Beijing to Shenzhen on the 27<sup>th</sup>, checked in at the hotel and quickly went through some GCC e-mails to hand off some responsibilities while I’m away. Then ensued the birthday festival that has become a tradition for one of my best friends in life. To me, it was a high school reunion, a networking party, and a vacation – a beautiful all-in-one package.</p>

<p>The following morning began at 4:59am, when I sat an alarm to wake myself. I had left the balcony doors open when I went to sleep. The waves were still going, the night still dark. We hopped into a car and sped toward Guangzhou airport, where we were to take an 8am flight to Guiyang, Guizhou, China.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">

<p>This was my third time visiting this same exact location where Heart2Heart built its first-ever school. We had ambitious plans. The plan was executed. And here we were, in front of a two-story brick building, of 60-70 children who have gone to or current go to the school, of the parents, the townsmen, and the government officials who have worked together to make a lofty goal of some high school students a reality.</p>

<p>I never cried when I saw them before. The children. This time there were children who we’ve seen four years ago. There were parents who we saw four years ago also… but were no longer around. This time I almost, well, cried.</p>
<p>I think Marco’s right –  because it felt like we weren’t gonna come back.</p>
<p>Life is future-bound at light-speed. The transition between the current stage and the next will complete when we have only found out that it has begun. Our lives as students are quickly coming to an end. Upon graduation, we will no longer be who we are today, nor will we act like students ever again.</p>
<p>I will remember the conversation we had on the way down the mountain, walking through blocks of stones in the dark of the night, covered by clouds. Life goes on, but with the end of one project comes the beginning of the next. When we grow older, we will have the power to do bigger – that which will bring bigger changes to this world than education opportunities for the children of one village on the mountaintop of a small town in the Southwestern part of China.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not that this wasn’t great, but we are simply shooting for more.</p>

            <p><strong>London</strong></p>
<p>To start with, London is damn expensive. <strong>Strong pound + high inflation = my poor wallet.</strong> A subway ride is 1.8GBP (2.0RMB in Beijing…). A cup of corn is 2 pounds, a waffle is 4.5. Clubbing makes you want to just take the next flight back to Beijing and head straight to Mix. Cover for men is 20 pounds, simplest mixed drinks are 8. Oh, and don’t even think about taking a cab. Airport ⇒ city = 70 pounds. Enough to 包车 for two full days in Beijing.</p>
<p>Surprise #2: From Wuhan to Vancouver to New York to Hong Kong to Beijing, I’ve never been to a place that is so class-conscious. It might’ve been too easy for me to classify North America and all of Europe as the “Western World.” Indeed they may be, but much less homogenous than I had anticipated. Social class definitely exists, in a way that’s much more visible than it is in the US or China.</p>
<p>Realization: Over here in London, I wholeheartedly felt what Adam Smith meant by “scarcity of resources,” and why mercantilism made so much sense for a naval power. Cuz this place is tiny! When each has too little, you take it from the outside; when there are too many of you and not enough coming in from the outside, you send them off to the outside. The royalty had places like the Buckingham Palace, the rich had the small houses and the poor had nothing.  If I were standing here 200 years ago, immigration to the United States just made so much sense. Why after being in London at the bottom I’d think a two-acre plot in the middle of nowhere in Wisconsin would be the best thing in the world. It comes glazed with sunshine too!</p>
<p>The pictures below are misleading - it was sunny for only 2/8 days I was there, which’s why I took so many photos on those two days =P. Just Photoshop the pictures below wherever you see skyblue - just replace it with gray and you’ll get London on a normal day.</p>
<p>[caption id=”” align=”alignnone” width=”766” caption=”London - an expensive living.”]<img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_yy2q73wYCCU/TPNgzamLzyI/AAAAAAAAC9o/6aSyVvKl83Y/s912/UK%20Trip.jpg" alt="" title="London">[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>Oxbridge</strong></p>
<p>It would have been an honor to study here. Perhaps. Perhaps too much of an honor.</p>
<p>Those were my thoughts when I toured through Oxford and Cambridge, college after college. The buildings that made up the college campus were breathe-taking… only too literally. I could feel my heartbeat – it was some pressure just by standing there and absorbing the landscape – every atom was filled with history, and I, by simply standing there, was intruding with my Panasonic camera, cotton sweater, denim jeans, and non-royal blood and perhaps the wrong eye color.</p>
<p>I took a picture in front of King’s College to play on the fact that Columbia was once named such. But thinking back to my days of entering into Columbia, I felt welcomed. Here, I felt… not so welcomed. No, no one told me that I wasn’t. No one would. No one needed to. It was a very natural instinct that you just got like when you just walked into a room where people were discussing private matters – you just knew.</p>

<p>There was this girl, playing the piano inside of that chapel (picture on the very left). The chapel was gorgeous – spot-lighted at all the right places, furnished with dark wooden benches, and the sound, oh the sound, it was the sort of thing you could only see and hear in movies, because quite honestly, there is nowhere else in the world the can replicate this stuff. This stuff was legit beyond reason. This stuff was as authentic as it gets.</p>
<p>At St. George’s, where I attended high school, we had a chapel too. Only it just wasn’t legit. The lighting, the walls, the images, the piano, even the air – it wasn’t authentic. Comparing it to this, the St. George’s version seemed more mockery than imitation. That’s how bad it was. At least in my memory.</p>
<p>Also, we hosted formal dinners weekly, and I sat next to the headmaster on the head table. But no, it wasn’t the same. Sure, it felt good, but looking at the dining hall of the Oxford colleges, where Harry Potter was filmed, I felt like back in high school we had been having afternoon tea with Styrofoam cups and Lipton all along, but here in this hall, at Oxford, you’d be sipping Earl Grey in real china.</p>
<p><strong>Shakespeare’s Globe</strong></p>
<p>Of all the wonderful things in the great city of London, I wanted to see this the most. I couldn’t really figure out why, until I sat down inside the wooden bench made out of oak and got slammed by what felt like childhood memories. High school – and alllll five years of it. Whether it was in public or private schools, with great teachers or sorry ones, in Honor-ed or dishonoring English classes, there was one connecting point, one thread of memory just vague enough that you can recall every detail as soon as you hear the first line of evocation: <em>To be or not to be… that is the question.</em> – The omnipresence of Shakespeare in my early academic life.</p>
<p>The thing about Shakespeare is that most people didn’t really enjoy reading it. It would’ve been harder than reading a medical textbook. At least with medical terms you can just look them up in a dictionary – with Shakespeare you had to decide between you and the author who actually spoke English. The funnier thing about Shakespeare is that I ended up liking it a lot, and I think some others did too, but none of us wanted to admit it, at least not in a very open, outright sort of way. Not in an all-boy boarding school where rugby was the subject of the daily athletics sermon.</p>

<p>Digging a little deeper, I think I’ve figured out why Shakespeare created such a strong impression in my mind – when studying his works, we did everything to make the stuff real. We read out loud and acted the stuff out in class; we watched videos and listened to recordings; we attended shows and saw the pros do it in real life, in costumes of different eras; we even had comic books on it. We then repeat this process every year for five years. Now how can you NOT remember his stuff? The power of propaganda. The psychological intrusion of inception. I like Shakespeare. If only Shakespeare were Canadian I’d now have now be more loyal to the maple leaf than I am to the queen.</p>
<p>But the fascinating thing is that, what they did for Shakespeare, they did for French too. I took three/four years of French and there were plenty of videos and funny-looking faces trying to teach us how to speak/read/write Canada’s second official language. But I never got interested… No offence to the language or anything, I think it’s the system’s problem. So here’s where I figured out that Shakespeare had real value – he taught us about love, hate, treason, life and death. French classes taught us numbers, colors, dates, orangina and croissant.</p>
<p>Having studied <em>A Mid-Summer Night’s Dream</em>, <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>King Leer</em>, and <em>Hamlet</em>… I apparently have read more Shakespeare than some of the Brits! How very proud I am now of my Canadian schooling system. The Chinese should model after this for 国学.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This trip reaffirmed my desire to stay in, or around, China. Britain is supposed to be one of the most advanced European countries running one of Europe’s best economies, but what I saw was more than uninspiring – at least for me, a Chinese person, or a person from the Far East as they would call it.</p>
<p>The most concerning factor in Europe is their human capital. Labor utilization rate and productivity. In simpler terms, how long people work for and how efficient do they work. Both, in my humble opinion, have a lot to do with culture. In other words, there’s no simple, short-term fix for this, because culture doesn’t just change overnight. Both, in my humble opinion, put China in the escalator going up and Europe on the elevator going down.</p>
<p>Once again, I felt an in-depth pride for being Chinese. Work hard, play harder, make bank. None of which shall take place in the great city of London, unfortunately. Maybe for an authentic meal + afternoon tea ;)</p>

            <p>Of all my whimsical decisions in life - and there haven’t been many, really, not even the great Gap Year - this one probably is sitting near the top of the list:</p>
<p>I am in London.<br>(Yes, I am that unexciting).</p>
<p>The 11-hour flight on British Airways from Beijing to London was delayed by an hour due to - surprise - 航空管制. Flight was great. Food sucked. Didn’t watch their movies because after all British Airways ain’t no Cathay Pacific. Met a fellow Chinese person who now works in Edinburgh. And we talked for quite a bit about… GCC. How sad. Well we talked more than just about GCC, but I’ve learned that it creates more of an impression than talking about Goldman Sachs. (Can someone in GCC pay me for saying this?) No actually we began by talking about the iPad and how to jailbreak it (Apple is more likely to pay me than GCC so… oh wait, I mentioned jailbreaking…). </p>
<p>Anyhow, sitting in the airport and taking a minute to collect myself: Pounds + SIM card + phone numbers = Functional human being.</p>
<p>Meeting up with a friend from GS over the summer later. </p>
<p>It’s amazing how this airport alone left me with such a great impression of London. I am that shallow. Wow.</p>
<p>Will be up in 12 hours for a GCC conference call at 5am London time. I really feel now like I work for a non-profit organization.</p>
<p>Life is good,</p>
<p>From Heathrow</p>

            <p>中秋／国庆假期前后，事情发生的太多，进展太快，来不及一一写下。这里简短的来几句概括一下这两天的感想，等回头再回忆假期的事情。</p>
<p>拿到贝恩公司的PTA工作了，非常兴奋的在第一天就从早上10点工作到了凌晨1点。第一个任务：做survey。在东方新天地逮了数个小时的人，愿意做我这份3页纸survey的人真的实在太少。这一下午遭到的拒绝总数就已经超过了我平时一年的总和。</p>
<p>我灵机一动，直奔一个目标人群聚集的街－果然，命中率几乎100％。Easy, I thought. It’s all about finding the right target.</p>
<p>但几个小时之后，我累了。</p>
<p>我终于了解到了survey是多么他妈的难做。在一个陌生人几乎不怎么打招呼的社会里，starting a conversation with a stranger 就像是用手来拨菠萝皮一样－it’s just not meant to be done that way. 找人做survey都怎么难，可想而知推销产品有多难了。在学校bubble中的我们总是把事情想的很容易。还记得，我一开始觉得survey这种东西肯定很容易－you just need persistence. And I can be persistent. Well… turns out it’s a lot harder than it looks.</p>
<p>在东单的一个十字路口的栏杆上依着，我的腿部和脚底都在以疼痛向我抗议。And then it hit me. I have only been walking for about a week (including the days when I spent finding an apartment and moving), and already my legs are getting killed by the vastness of Beijing. 但是和那些站着一天的工作比起来，我的工作简直是天堂。而仔细想想，在这个世界上，站一天的工作要远远多过不站一天的：店员，服务员，工厂工人，工地工人，保安，保姆，阿姨 - basically, probably the majority of what’s deemed to be a “job” in this world requires more standing time than sitting time.</p>
<p>There is a difference between this and the feeling you get when witnessing extreme poverty. Extreme poverty tells you that the gap between rich and poor is that between heaven and hell; but this tells you what it means when the world tells you that you are the top 0.001% of the population in terms of income - it means the small difference between how much time you get to sit vs. standing. Or it tells you how weak you are compare to those who can take it.</p>
<p>一个普通的店员，在站了一天后，做地铁，走，买菜，走，回家，做饭，洗碗，洗衣。。。 她还有时间做别的吗？</p>
<p>一天下来累的想死，发觉原来社会的阶层是可以由时间的多少来决定的。The wealth people don’t stand or walk as much, and thus have more energy to focus on other things. They do not have to cook everyday, or do their own laundry, so thus have more time to do what can create more opportunities for them - client dinners, networking events, making phone calls, building contacts. The difference between rich and poor, in this sense, is not really about not having the right access - it’s more like the lack of time and the energy that can be used during that time to gain those accesses.</p>
<p>我这也算是体验了基层工作吧，只是没想到会是在贝恩 lol.</p>

            <p>(I wrote this at the end of finals last semester when I was done with school and wanted to think of an entrepreneurial idea to start up a company with… again, sharing this quite late =P):</p>
<p>Ever been fascinated by how much you can learn in less than a week?</p>
<p>Every finals week for me has been an reenactment of the same process leading up to the moment of epiphany - the recognition my own mental capacity. All of a sudden I resurrect as myself at the smartest, the brightest, the most hard-working and tireless state. I am superhuman. Because I just learned <em>a semester worth of crap in less than ten hours</em>. But with the injection of limited dosage of optimism, I should probably look behind myself and realize for how long in the past semester I have been functioning, very much voluntarily and rationally, at limited mental capacity.</p>
<p>I have thought about so many things that I would deem as “witty” or “smart” this past week while studying. Ideas, questions, answers, and resolutions that would have been great essay topics, class discussions, or just points of curiosity that I could have learned about by merely approaching the expert within an arm’s reach - the professor. Granted, not every professor is worth reaching out to, but some of them are - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs" target="_blank" rel="external">Jeffrey Sachs</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Plenty-Millennium-Princeton-Economic/dp/0691143277/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1273995628&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="external">Ronald Findlay</a>, <a href="http://ineteconomics.org/people/advisors/perry-g-mehrling" target="_blank" rel="external">Perry Mehrling</a>.</p>
<p>True, I have forgotten a lot of these random, witty thoughts already. They sneak out of your brain as they squeeze in - instantaneously. I used to keep some of these ideas on my cellphone, a sheet of paper… somewhere. But such habits, as I have learned, unless reinforced by <strong>brutality</strong> (either self-induced or externally-imposed), is rarely instilled permanently.</p>
<p>This time, one thought sticked around because - and only because - I sent it to myself in an e-mail as soon as I thought about it. The thought was about entrepreneurship - because while studying, I was wondering why, if I was in fact smart, was I not able to come up with a goddamn creative million-dollar idea??</p>
<p>And here it is… (the thought, not the million-dollar idea. Sorry.)</p>
<p>I was studying for music hum, during which I listened to the same 50 songs over and over again for 5 hours (don’t need to study much for music hum… but the songs sticked around much longer… they sticked around for days, and I remember writing a Corporate Finance exam while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg" target="_blank" rel="external">Schoenberg</a> was playing in my head - <strong>not</strong> a pleasant experience), and I thought about the difference between innovation in art vs. innovation in business.</p>
<p>Art is driven by personal desire to innovate, to create something that <strong>detracts</strong> from the mainstream - because in many cases the best way to become famous is to be different. Art can go anywhere - there is really no boundaries to it.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurial innovation is different in that it is driven by the newly developed wants and needs in existence in this earthly world.</p>
<p>Sure, you can argue that art can sometimes be a reaction to certain earthly changes (e.g. the French Revolution and how it transformed Romanticism), but that is what remains popular/mainstream. The point is that art can <strong>also</strong> be done on the anti-popular and anti-mainstream side - but entrepreneurial creations cannot. Entrepreneurial innovations by nature MUST be popular and mainstream - or else who’s gonna buy your crap???</p>
<p>So in summary, it appears as if it is hard to be an entrepreneur because you have to think along side with consumers and innovate in line with what is <em>already</em> accepted. On the contrary, artists can just do whatever the hell has not been done before, using various media and, <em>voila</em>, the next masterpiece.</p>
<p>So I’ve solved for myself why coming up with the next million-dollar idea is going to be slightly tougher than the next artistic masterpiece. Still, I’m a big believer in that <em>necessity drives innovation</em>. If we all went bankrupt today and had to think of something to make money, or if our GPA was all of a sudden tied up to how great an entrepreneurial idea we can come up with, I’m sure all the college students would use a lot more of the creativity that they possess to come up with ideas. Given how we can learn a semester of work in a week (and therefore a whole school year worth of work in 14 days), I’m sure coming up with a million-dollar idea won’t be hard.</p>

            <p>“That’s so cool!” is usually the first reaction I receive when I entrust someone with my idea of taking a gap year.</p>
<p>“So what are you gonna do?” is usually the sentence immediately following that.</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest here for a second before returning to my full-on 忽悠 mode: I don’t know.</p>
<p>… Entrepreneurship? … Management consulting? … Finance??</p>
<p>Ten weeks in finance. I witness the S&amp;P fall to its regional low of 1,022, its correction back to around 1,120 on the back of strong 2Q earnings, and then its dip back down when bank after bank began downgrading economic forecasts of both the emerging markets and OECD. Economics aside, I learned a lot about not so much investments, but rather investor mentalities. On our portfolio trading simulation team, no one knew which stock was going to make  us money. We made bets on Visa, on Amazon, on tech ETFs, but no one knew. Ten weeks may have allowed me to skim the surface of some fundamental and technical analyses, but really, I’m barely skimming the surface and I already see how deep the water must be. No one who has the money in the pool is going to stay calm and undisturbed when thousands and thousands of market news cross-pollinate to create a jungle of uncertainty. The incentive structure of the information distribution system in the investment world is skewed up and to the right. Good times everyone makes money, bad times no one talks and the floor contains as much noise as the inside of a morgue. Institutions make bank while prop traders follow, and private investors stand outside the fence wondering what’s up.</p>
<p>If there is something I learned and decided this summer, it’s that I don’t ever want to be an equity fund manager. If I knew the chances of me outperforming  the market is so slim, why do I even bother?</p>
<p>Finance is tough and unpredictable. But economics is fun. It’s simple, it’s intuitive, it’s manipulable. This is why economists can get more attention by talking (think Paul Krugman, 郎咸平, etc.), because they don’t have to perform. They just have to talk. I mean really what’s the secret formula here for global fame? Get some very legit credentials (e.g. win the Nobel Prize in Economics), and then say some very controversial stuff (e.g. China is screwing over the US). Maybe hire 10 analysts to get you economic data to support your claims. Save the world while you’re at it.</p>
<p>So back to the topic here… gap year.</p>
<p>I turned down the attractive offer and decided to “explore,” and rather than just taking a semester off and graduate on time, I decided to graduate a year later. It was not an easy decision, for me or for my parents. I’ll explain this part in Chinese:</p>
<p>“休学”这两个字在中国家长的耳中似乎象征着某种不祥的物质。这因该是因为大部分在中国世界里休学的人都是在非自愿地情况下休学：分数低到不及格了，病倒需要动大手术了，心里因为某种原因受刺激了，等等。凡休学者，定没好事儿。</p>
<p>可是如果休学是为了在走出校门之前更清楚的知道自己的兴趣呢？了解什么样的工作最适合自己呢？尝试这辈子都不会再尝试的事情呢？</p>
<p>有没有家长为子女想过，在我们每天于校门内外奔波，与试卷课题武斗，为功名利禄所奴用，马不停蹄地为了在他人的眼中活的更高等，更高尚的时候，我们的自我呢？如果全天下有亿万件可做的事情，那在我们闭上眼睛的那一刻时我们都各自做了多少件呢？的确， 有时我们沿着主流社会走，可以走得很高，很远，可以改变世界。但现实是大部分人都不会走到那一天。大部分人在沿着现实走的时候会看到前面的路并不通往改变世界的大门，而是一个普普通通的骨灰盒。</p>
<p>休学。做自己想做的事情。</p>
<p>当你违背父母意愿走出第一步的时候，你的包袱就已经比前一步的时候要重得多。休得好了，父母可以认为你本就可以做好，不需要休学。休得不好了，父母可以将一切错误怪罪与休学这一重大的错误决定。</p>
<p>但是人不应该为了任何一个非主流的决策而后悔。因为主流的决策根本不是难事。当你做出了一个非主流的决策时，你是真正的做了决策了。你冒险了。你他妈男人了。</p>
<p>这几个星期，我去了青海，丽江，杭州，深圳，香港，武汉，最后会到北京。我看了（我眼中）最现代的，最原始的，最昂贵的，最便宜的，中国。我会到了五花八门的人，跟每一个人都想取经，了解他们在做什么，为什么做这个。</p>
<p>我知道在这一年之后，我会更清楚自己站在什么地方，该做什么事情。</p>
<p>到时，不会有任何遗憾，任何眷恋，任何责怪。因为我做了。</p>

            <p><a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/photo-2.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="external"></a>A few minutes ago, I officially announced the change in leadership for the GCC Network and the move of dividing up the Network Management Division and Network Expansion Division.</p>
<p>As Aaron said, there is something intriguing about the fact that the NMD is the only division in GCC that has been handed off to a third Director since GCC was first founded. The first sign of “longevity” - even if only <em>relative</em> in comparison to the other divisions or student groups - is a sign of inner stability.</p>
<p><a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/photo-2.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/photo-2.jpeg?w=225" alt="" title="Business Card"></a></p>
<p>Building GCC was very much like building a company. The management structure has morphed from a strict division of responsibilities, to a more organic entity, back to a very well-defined system of individual divisions. Like an entrepreneurial firm, the structure needed to adapt constantly to the environment - timing, location, people. If this sounds familiar it’s because it is the familiar “天時，地利，人和” trinity, the circumstances that <em>will</em> determine the success or failure of any entity.</p>
<p>Just as instrumental music became popular in Europe when the technology of making musical instruments flourished, GCC grew and prospered drastically as China became the outlier of economic performance, exceeding expectations and creating exceptions. We have tapped into the biggest shift of paradigm in the 21st century in so many different ways it’s impossible to foresee what will be the exact outcome. But in an environment where too many factors are changing and too many uncertainties lay ahead, the best thing to do is to follow your instinct - and the worst thing to do is to stay stationary.</p>
<p>自古亂世出英雄 - if you only live once, which I assume we all do, why not make something special of your life?</p>
<p>The exposure to the outside world through GCC has profoundly altered my interpretation of <strong>risk</strong> versus <strong>uncertainty</strong>. We are all risk-averse. But we cannot avoid uncertainty no matter what we do. Risk and uncertainty both exist as pure consequences of time, but risk can be calculated, modeled, and predicted; uncertainty however, is inevitable and must be embraced. The realization of the inevitability of uncertainty is the single most fundamental factor that changed much of my decision making process, and consequently, yielded the following decision:</p>
<p><em>I am going to take a semester off and spend it in China.</em></p>
<p>The decision is almost risk-free. But the decision is ridden with uncertainty. I have come to realize that while I am extremely risk-averse, I am not averse to uncertainty.</p>
