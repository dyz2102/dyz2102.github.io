    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">

      
      

      
        
          
            <p>A few of us attended the “亚布力到纽约” portion of the Chinese Entrepreneur Forum - the platform involving some of the largest business titans of China today and of the world tomorrow.</p>
<p>Upon entering the Morgan Library, the lobby was filled with familiar faces - the New York network of China-fans is probably smaller than we had anticipated.</p>
<p><strong>The Chinese Economy</strong></p>
<p>毛振华, 冯伦, 曹德旺, 任志强, 陈东升 etc., spoke on various topics relating to one of GCC’s core focuses - China’s economy.</p>
<p>冯伦, President of 万通地产, and a well-known author of some very interesting books on business in China, spoke about the “five views” that are in dialogue regarding China’s political future, ranging from liberalism to absolute Maoism. The predominant view, he says, is the middle-of-the-road “new” thought - slow but reasonable reforms in the government, maintaining peace and prosperity of the country as a whole. Undoubtedly, the view is supported by both large businesses as well as the Chinese government, and probably also preferred by us students who wish to pursue future career opportunities in China .</p>
<p>It is more true in China than anywhere else in the world that business success is highly tied to government policies. Feng observed that the most successful firms in China are ironically along the lines of government policy: the ones that are heavily regulated, and the ones that are not regulated at all. For me, this seems to refer to monopolies such as utilities and telecommunications, as well as the unknown districts of gambling, coal mining, and real estate (until last year).</p>
<p>Feng also touched on the fact that Chinese firms are now beginning to care about corporate image, environmental impacts, and social responsibilities. Chines firms are starting to put together additional pages in their annual reports focusing on sustainable dev and corporate responsibility. This should be good news enough for those of us taking classes with Jeffrey Sachs.</p>
<p>Other panelists emphasized that NGOs has yet to witness their Golden Age in China. With more people who are understanding the impacts of global trade, production, and consumption, there will be both more interest and more room for people to join NGOs to create impact in China. Interested in joining an NGO to work in China in the future? Now is probably the time.</p>
<p><strong>Finance in China</strong></p>
<p>陈东升, President and CEO of 泰康人寿, also left me deep impressions about the future of business in China. 泰康人寿 was founded in 1996, but is now the 4th largest insurance companies in China. Recently, the firm took 550 employees to the Great Pyramids of Giza for both entertainment as well as their annual firm-wide summit - yes, I can relate because I was just there about a month ago. Confirming with what the GCC delegation learned during the<a href="http://davidyzhu.wordpress.com/2010/01/16/some-observations/" target="_blank" rel="external"> Winter Delegation</a>, 混业经营 (Mixed Operation: the practice of merging banking, securities, insurance, and other forms of financial services together for synergetic outcomes) is still a big focus of the Chinese financial services world. On the insurance side, though the traditional models of insurance agents that were introduced to China via 友邦 of Taiwan (which originated from Japan), new practices such as selling insurance plans via commercial banks, selling by phone, online, etc., are all on the rise. 泰康 claims to be selling 100 life insurance plans per day.</p>
<p><strong>A Pleasant Surprise</strong></p>
<p>In the sea of passionate China-lovers who were eagerly networking between panels, I bumped into someone who is perhaps more famous than all of the prominent Chinese entrepreneurs in the room combined - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Girl" target="_blank" rel="external">哈佛女孩儿－刘亦婷</a>.</p>
<p>[caption id=”attachment_122” align=”aligncenter” width=”300” caption=”哈佛女孩儿－刘亦婷”]<a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/img_4683.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/img_4683.jpg?w=300" alt="" title="Yiting Liu"></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Fantastic isn’t it? If you are Chinese and you are currently in a top American college, you know who she is.</p>
<p>Sitting next to her during the speeches, I easily forgot that this “Harvard girl” whose fame swept across China as someone who has successfully made it into Harvard from Chengdu, China, is almost ten years my elder. Time flew by and her image as a 18-year-old Harvard girl remained in our memory, but the now-experienced finance professional moved onto better things. After a summer internship at Morgan Stanely followed by several years at BCG, Yiting LIu is now on her path to be an entrepreneur and create something on her own.</p>
<p>It’s in our blood - entrepreneurship. The phrase that “every Chinese wants to be an entrepreneur” was never an overstatement.</p>

<p>So I decided on a whim that getting an iPad for my dad would make him a very happy father.</p>
<p>While there is no question about the validity of my presumption, my purchase of the iPad has come under attack, scrutiny, mockery, and other forms of insult. The most unexpected of these exchanges, and possibly one of the more intellectually engaging ones, took place with strangers on the Facebook wall of a mutual friend:</p>
<hr>
<p>(Context: a high school pupil of mine updated his status to say that “iPhones are about to get alot better” - probably referring to the OS4 coming out. This stirred some dismissal of Apple’s OS in general for the iPhone. Someone then commented that “iPads are about to continue to be useless,” which then ignited a series of attack on the iPad: can’t multitask, expensive, useless, cash-cow for Apple, bigger iPhone, what’s Steve Jobs thinking, etc. etc. etc. As a proud new owner of the iPad, I stepped in to express my opinions because, well, it’s a free country last time I checked. <em>The names of the people are taken out for confidentiality purposes</em>.)</p>

<p><div></div></p>
<p><div id="text_expose_id_4bc4ef667588751f16b63">The speed of the ipad amazes me. It’s going to sell not because it’s “apple”, but because apple offers a chain of services, incorporating the product into a system that has many “subscribers” already. People who are anti-ipad are usually also anti-iPhone, anti-mac, and anti-apple in general. Without using a mac or iPhone, u just cannot experience the connectivity and universality of apple products first hand. I’ve synced my boss’s blackberry before, and I’ve spent hours on the phone with customer reps dealing with various hardware and software issues, and my conclusion is that apple has found a system to attract and to keep, and those who are outside will have to refrain from ever trying apple if they desire to remain outside forever.</div><br><br></p>

<p><div id="text_expose_id_4bc4ef66762c2616e5c9c">As an owner of an iPod, and someone seriously considering getting an iPhone, I disagree. I appreciate that apple offers a spoonfed oppurtunity to be connected, and would have nothing against them if they didn’t charge an arm and a leg for items that have the same capabilities, but are slightly easier to use. But to each their own, and if people are willing to pay more for the same thing, so be it. I admit that all of their products are well designed, but the iPad is really bloody useless, and an abuse of their fanbase if you ask me. Get an iPhone for less, its the same, but a cellphone too.</div></p>

<p><div>As a person who has worked on a Mac, have had a hackint0sh, own (and absolutely love) an iPod Touch, had a Windows Mobile phone, an iPhone, and currently a BlackBerry, I claim unbiasedness and politely (and completely) disagree. There’s a sea of people on the internets that are the biggest mac fanboys - who also think that Apple is just milking the idiots.</div><br>The “speed” you mention comes from a 1GHz processor (pretty paltry), which is specifically designed to perform and do exactly what Apple wants and specifies. This is why Apple is terrible - complete lack of open-sourceness in order to make things “just work”. What do customers do to combat that? Jailbreak. Now that JB and Apple’s so called “multi-task” is being released for the iPad, I can only see that the iPad will struggle with it’s 1GHz A4 lamesauce processor.</p>
<p>And by the way, I do experience the “universal+connectivity” of Apple products every day - when I sync my iPod on my PC. It’s great, but why does iTunes have to struggle on a 3.8GHz i7 processor? Why does Apple such terrible developers? WHYY?<img src="http://ragecomic.appspot.com/packs/rage2/images/Horror.png" alt="http://ragecomic.appspot.com/packs/rage2/images/Horror.png"></p>
<p>TL;DR: Apple is fucking evil. We all know it.</p>

<p>yea i agree with albert, the ipod touch and iphone are way better compared to ipads. plus it fits into your pocket! :D<br>i’m a regular commuter and i rather have something portable and mobility-friendly for the same functions as iphone or touch. and since i already have a laptop that i always carry to school, i guess i dont need it lol<br>but ipod touch or iphone i’ll take it :D</p>

<p><div id="text_expose_id_4bc4efcdb000f6ba9b089">The problem is not one of “need” but one of “convenience” - no one needs the iPad - it’s a device that did not exist in the market before. What it will bring to the table is a new way of completing tasks, new way of tracking information, new way of sharing and networking - and even doing new things that were not done before.For Albert and Bob - for the sake of this dialogue, have you guys gotten your hands on an iPad? If yes, do you find that it’s just as fast as your iPhone? Slightly faster? Or significantly faster?If you have not played with an iPad before, then I think this dialogue might be less meaningful. I initially rejected it as a “big iPhone” and was not going to waste my money on it. However, once I stepped got my hands on it, it was immediately clear to me that this thing was worth investing in if you intend to stay on top of the mobile technology world.You might also find this article helpful:</div></p>

<p><br><br>As a comment from the VentureBeat-Mobile Beat article puts best:</p>
<p>“The iPad is not a phone replacement, it is not a laptop replacement, it is not a portable gaming device replacement, it is not a portable DVD replacement, it is not a Kindle replacement (Kindle has a 10 day not 10 hour batter life, for example. It is also much lighter), etc. It is an entirely new personal device that has a place. I can’t tell you exactly what it is, but I can feel it. This is not enough to be an effective relayer of word-of-mouth. I bought my iPad as a personal indulgence and a desire to feel the future in my hands. That’s not mass market motivation.”</p>
<p><strong>Albert:</strong></p>
<p>I would rather not pay $500 dollars for a convenience I did not need until this monstrosity was conceived. You’re only strengthening the argument that Apple is milking its fans by creating new niches that shouldn’t have been created in the first place. Bottom line - a Netbook is more functional, a cellphone is more portable and <em>almost</em> as functional (though, if you look at the HTC HD2 for example, it out-specs the iPad, LOL, so one can assume that <em>gasp</em> user created content <em>/gasp</em> will allow cellphones to match the iPad in functionality), and it doesn’t support flash.<br>I’ll end with a quote from that link:<br>“But you have to think of this device as something like a MacBook Air. That, too, is missing a lot of functional things that other laptops have, but it is so thin and cool that people who buy it, and pay more money for it than a regular laptop, don’t seem to care.”<br>Lol MacBook Air.</p>
<p>I concede that it seems really cool, and is probably really awesome to use at first, but it has just absolutely terrible value for the amount of money you are putting in, and the novelty will wear off shortly.</p>
<p>And say I was to invent the iTurd, an amazing new device that fills the niche between a laptop and a desktop (requires an AC power source at all times, too big to fit in a convenient case, but small enough to carry around the house to a new location easily), so that its almost portable, but not really. It comes with the processing power of a laptop (the lowest common denominator in this situation), a price tag of a souped up desktop (the highest common denominator), and is very aesthetically pleasing with some very cool, unique user friendly functions that grab your attention but are intrinsically flawed in that a desktop would do them better. Would you get it?</p>
<p>P.S. Expect this in two years if Apple keeps with their current business strategy (invent niche, fill niche).</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong></p>
<p>If you are happy with it, that’s great David. Canadian’s haven’t had the opportunity to play with it yet - I’m looking forward to visiting the Apple store soon.</p>
<p>“PC fanboys” (I use this term VERY loosely) have rejected the iPad for one single reason: it doesn’t do anything exceedingly well, although the price point says it should, especially for what you physically get. However, you’re right. No one needs an iPad, but no one should judge what a person can or can’t buy.</p>
<p>The way I see it, the iPad is a toy. If you need to do serious work, what are you going to choose - a mouse and keyboard or a touchscreen keyboard with no tactile feedback? If you’re outside and want to watch a video or play music, what are you going to use - an iPhone or an iPad? IF you want to play some games or use some over-the-top (aka useless) apps, I guess I’d use an iPad.</p>
<p>This new tablet niche won’t die. It’s a great concept, and it shows the amazing steps we have taken in technology over the years. The point I’m trying to make, however, is that Apple stepped forward with a product that lacks the software and hardware to take full advantage of this tablet niche, while charging an exorbitant amount. Let’s wait for the Google tablet (actually coming), shall we?</p>
<p>Apple will always be Apple - if that’s a synonym for being assholes.<br><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/08/apples-iphone-lockdown-apps-must-be-written-in-one-of-three-la/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/08/apples-iphone-lockdown-apps-must-be-written-in-one-of-three-la/</a></p>
<p><strong>My last comment:</strong></p>
<p>Bob - very much appreciate your comment. I completely agree that the iPad is a toy - but it creates the possibility beyond what traditional gaming consoles can do.</p>
<p>With the iPad, I can imagine classes being remotely taught, house lights/sound/windows/curtains/TVs being remotely controlled, meetings being held (with an external camera), presentations being made, and more that I have not thought of.</p>
<p>If someone wants to tell me that you can do all of the above with some sort of software on a PC netbook - forget it. Niche softwares on PCs are glitchy enough that no one will devote the energy and time into making amazing softwares that will make the users happy with it. It will also probably cost a million bucks for something like that. I owned a netbook once - I hated it because the screen was too small, the keyboard was too small, the trackpad was too small, and it was also heavy for its size.</p>
<p>The possibility of coming home from school, taking out a device, turn on various parts of the room, turn on the clock app when going to bed, and set alarm for the next day; wake up, take device to school, read the news on the bus, take notes in class, draw pictures, record class lectures, and come home with homework assignments entered automatically from school’s server - this is the kind of combo beyond that of a netbook or a mobile phone.</p>
<p>I do not disagree the Google might be able to come up with something better - in fact I am very much looking forward to it as well. Competition is a positive trait of free market economy, and filling niches as a strategy is nothing wrong as well.</p>
<p>Albert - You mentioned that “Apple is milking its fans by creating new niches that shouldn’t have been created in the first place.” So what do you say about Microsoft? Sony? Nintendo? Or online farming games? I do not understand the concept of a niche that should <em>not</em> have been created. Innovation drives the world forward, unless you’re developing weapons.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">So I just wanted to hear what are your opinions here. I might just be a blind consumer who’s trying to justify my impromptu decision. Let’s not focus on the tech spec too much here - ultimately, none of us are computer engineers or product managers with the knowledge base to debate the merit of the iPad’s intrinsic (endogenous) value. Rather, I think we should focus on the American consumer culture - who are going to buy the iPads, who will like it, how has Apple successfully marketed itself?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight:normal;"><br></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight:normal;"> </span></strong></p>
<p>[caption id=”” align=”alignright” width=”432” caption=”Steve Jobs with Apple&#39;s new game-changer.”]<img src="http://www.inc.com/uploaded_files/image/ipad-unveiling-pop_2778.jpg" alt="" title="Jobs"><br>[/caption]</p>
<p>Ultimately though, I am of course not going to regret my decision because after all, I am bringing the iPad to China. Consumer culture is completely different over there. Products derive value not based on their usefulness, but almost solely on their desirability. Desirability is in turn determined by numerous exogenous factors such as word-of-mouth, foreignness, or lack of supply (the Chinese golden rule of “物以稀為貴”).</p>
<p>As someone on Venture Beat comments:</p>
<p>“The iPad is not a phone replacement, it is not a laptop replacement, it is not a portable gaming device replacement, it is not a portable DVD replacement, it is not a Kindle replacement (Kindle has a 10 day not 10 hour batter life, for example. It is also much lighter), etc. It is an entirely new personal device that has a place. I can’t tell you exactly what it is, but I can feel it. This is not enough to be an effective relayer of word-of-mouth. I bought my iPad as a personal indulgence and a desire to feel the future in my hands. That’s not mass market motivation.</p>
<p>For most people, the iPad is simply unjustifiable. Kids may nag their parents for it (or not), but the parents will push back.</p>
<p>It’s too damn expensive and it isn’t a clear upgrade for anything. Who (besides developers and fools like me) can justify it?</p>
<p>Still, it’s one of the most satisfying consumer purchases I’ve ever made and I drink in the envy everywhere I go. I am so cool I don’t even need a refrigerator for my beer.”</p>
<p>Meet the iPad - a new gadget for developers, fools, and the Chinese.</p>

            <p><img src="http://www.chicagobooth.edu/execmba/world-class/class-stats/images/chicago_stats_jobfunction.gif" alt="" title="Industry Job Functions ">A thought popped up my mind while I was in Topics of Money and Finance.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann-Morgenstern_utility" target="_blank" rel="external">John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern</a> explained decision making by using expect utility theory in 1944. A large part of the foundation of their idea lies in the utility function - an alternative way of understanding value of goods in the market after scholars abandoned the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value" target="_blank" rel="external">Labor Theory of Value </a>favored by Classical and Marxian economists. In essence, the little sticky price tags on the myriad goods in supermarkets depended no on how much it costs to make the goods, but rather on how “happy” consumers are by purchasing them.</p>
<p>I suppose this explains why there are so many differentiated products on the market from a demand perspective. Sure, for the supplier, the enterprise is engaging in competitive behavior and opening up new markets by offering differentiated products. However, from a pure consumer perspective, perhaps all we wanted was variety, for the simple reason that our marginal utility on each “new” differentiated product is higher than the marginal utility on a second unit of any product that we already consume. (I certainly felt this way when I made a point of buying a different flavor of vitamin water every time until I have tried all of them - yes, I probably fell for their marketing tricks, but so have a lot of people I’m sure.)</p>
<p>This leads to my next supposition. What if one can gain more utility by performing different job functions? Suppose you start with network management. You become familiar with the process of managing chapters and keeping correspondence, but the more you do it the less utility you generate by performing the job function. Eventually you become tired of managing chapters and want to try something new. You then move to communications and begin dealing with speakers and invited guests to various events. Similarly, you begin with a high utility but gradually declines as time goes on.</p>
<p>In some ways the utility function would be similar to the learning curve - except the learning curve doesn’t measure how “happy” you are. And happiness matters significantly more in a non-salary-paying world.</p>
<p>But the other side of the story is that you are specializing whenever you spend longer time performing the same task. So there must be a trade-off between utility and value of specialization. In the real world, companies reward specialization by increasing the wage or salary. In a NPO where specialization is not measured by the amount of salary paid, how do we make sure everyone is happy doing the same job over an extended period of time? Each division therefore must figure out ways to reward specialization. Sure, promotion certainly serves as a huge incentive, even in the real world. But the nature of promotion implies that there will be some who are not promoted. For them, their utility must be supplemented, if not sustained, by both tangible and intangible rewards for specializing.</p>
<p>A lot of this clearly is not all that well-thoughtout, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know!</p>

            <p>I turn 21 today.</p>
<p>How do I feel about it? To be perfectly honest. Nothing much.</p>
<p>I can’t grasp if I am simply feeling jaded about the social life of <a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00094ARRI.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external">Planet College</a>, or I am just too busy now to take my time to organize <em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=60477&amp;id=1669500058" target="_blank" rel="external">Party with the Zhukeeper</a>__ III</em>. No. It can’t be the latter. I was just as busy in freshman year, when I went to meetings from 7-10pm on consecutive weekdays, gave tours at the Visitors Center, socialized like I had never seen humans before, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/dyz2102" target="_blank" rel="external">performed</a> at every possible event - I was just as busy as I am right now. I don’t feel so jaded either - I still enjoy every minute here, executing every action with passion.</p>
<p>But I did not pause my cramming session for Jeffrey Sachs’ <em>Challenges of Sustainable Development</em> class to write down my newfound nonchalance toward birthdays. I am here up at 2am because I have received some “new” happy birthday wishes, a category of birthday wishes that did not exist until this year - wishes from friends that are friends at a different capacity than ever before; wishes from the <em>network</em>.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon that individuals develop a sense of emotional accomplishment within the GCC network and find the need to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=189049424615" target="_blank" rel="external">put them in words</a>. However, <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.rapingmothernature.com/wp-content/gallery/seaturtle/SeaTurtle004.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.rapingmothernature.com/2008/08/06/sea-turtle/&amp;usg=__IOPIHw4H0ilFdtxBL_7Px82OXHM=&amp;h=688&amp;w=1050&amp;sz=172&amp;hl=en&amp;start=30&amp;sig2=8NPbRretZrcW9-pBhCY78Q&amp;um=1&amp;itbs=1&amp;tbnid=uUUuW9unbnEjyM:&amp;tbnh=98&amp;tbnw=150&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dsea%2Bturtle%26start%3D18%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DN%26ndsp%3D18%26tbs%3Disch:1&amp;ei=PXWWS__HGpKE8QbFlJncDQ" target="_blank" rel="external">getting there</a> (and speaking from experience) can be very tough.</p>
<p>Associates on the <a href="http://gccglobal.org/network" target="_blank" rel="external">Network Management Division</a> have come and gone. There are of course exogenous reasons beyond our control. But chapter advisory is not a job for just anyone. Many have complained the lack of a sense of “accomplishment” and “progress.” Tangible outcomes. The connection between efforts and rewards. The key aspect of an enjoyable job (or in this case, extracurricular activity).</p>
<p>Management is building solutions for a relationship-based problem. It is communicating effectively and understanding the needs of the other person at the other end of the line while proposing solutions in a way that will make “everyone” happy. It is the creation of Pareto efficiency in the realm of P2P communications.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a chapter does not follow through with promises, what do we do? <em>Cut</em> is not always the right answer. They may have done extremely well in the past.</li>
<li>A chapter cannot communicate with the advisor assigned effectively. What should I do? We cannot always just <em>reassign</em> - there may not be enough associates to take on more chapters.</li>
<li>I am struck by fifteen mid-terms in two days and must be MIA for an extended period of time. I let something slip through the cracks. What do I do as supervisor? “I apologize for getting this back to you so late…” But why not a quick exchange on gchat? “Hey, how you doin? I’m really sorry there’s been fifteen midterms …”<br>You are probably thinking: <em>Are e-mail and gchat really that different?</em> Yes - they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a million decisions that need to be made in every communication. Have you ever found yourself in these positions: What’s form of communication should you use? Text, chat, phone, voice mail, video, or just e-mail? What’s the tone you want to use? What format in the e-mail? Where to bold, italicize, underline? What level of mitigated speech should you use? How to use it? Are you sure you are using it correctly? Should you doubt your phrases? Should you let the receiver know that you’re doubting yourself? What sort of response would you prompt? How might that affect the overarching goal of this communication? Have you double-checked your e-mail? Did you forget an attachment? Did you remember to CC someone? <em>Are you thinking too much about all of this?</em></p>
<p>Some of these decisions seem minor and probably will not matter in the grand scheme of things. But I am here to argue that they do. Non-physical communication eliminates all possibilities of physical language, which supposedly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_language" target="_blank" rel="external">encompasses 60-70% of human communications</a>. In the world of cyber communication, you are not a person - you are words, fonts, colors, tone, voice, and maybe 1 billion pictures on Facebook if the other person really cared.</p>
<p>Therefore, the considerations listed above determine the success of the communications, and the communications determine the success of the ultimate outcome.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the “new” birthday wishes (even one from <a href="http://www.univ-tlse1.fr/1265105948403/0/fiche___associationetudiant/&amp;RH=ASSOCIATIONETUDIANT" target="_blank" rel="external">Toulouse, France</a> [special shout-out to Marianna for a wonderful <a href="http://cards.mail.ru/f4/card.html?cd=96bed555252301cf2665dc34c388e2c8" target="_blank" rel="external">e-card</a>!]), because they come from those that I have communicated with successfully. And because of the success of these communications, I found a balance between <em>effort</em> and <em>reward</em>.</p>
<p>Reaching the landmark age of 21 may not mean as much to me on a cultural or social level as it it assumed to for the vast majority of American college students. But the “new” birthday wishes I have received give me a new sense of purpose. The story of my running of the network is a story of how to create Pareto efficiency in organization - using words.</p>

    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">

      
      

      
        
          
            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Chan" target="_blank" rel="external">Mr. Ronnie Chan</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_Lung_Properties" target="_blank" rel="external">Hang Lung Properties Ltd</a>. recently published <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/05dea378-f895-11de-beb8-00144feab49a.html" target="_blank" rel="external">an article at the Financial Times</a>. The title is rather catchy - “The west’s preaching to the east must stop” - a title filled with patriotism and a hint of annoyance. A talk last Thursday night focused predominantly on the content of this article.</p>
<p>In essence, Mr. Chan argues for five of what he calls “global rebalancing” between East and West:</p>
<ol>
<li>a rebalancing of moral authority</li>
<li>a shift in decision-making power in global economic affairs</li>
<li>a shift in the centre of economic gravity from the Atlantic to the Pacific</li>
<li>a movement away from a total dependence on the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b163f502-cf02-11de-8a4b-00144feabdc0.html" title="Financial Times - Plea to reduce demand for dollar reserves" target="_blank" rel="external">US dollar as the global trading currency</a></li>
<li>a movement to a more balanced and stable world<br>In his speech delivered to a group of around thirty at the Citi Executive Conference Center, Ronnie surprised me as someone that is not only successful in business, but also extremely bold and intelligent.</li>
</ol>
<p>His article sounds great to Asian ears - who doesn’t like to hear that your side of the world is triumphing while the old “winner” is now on the “losing” side? On the issue of morality, Mr. Chan wrote, “Now some in America are <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/12dd09e0-4e07-11de-a0a1-00144feabdc0.html" title="Financial Times - China and US share economic umbilical cord" target="_blank" rel="external">advocating a G2 with only the US and China</a>. If the focus shifts to the G2 to make decisions, then what happens to democracy? The west has a moral dilemma.”</p>
<p>On the fourth issue, Mr. Chan wrote, “Over time some countries will keep more renminbi, making it more like a reserve currency.” Some how I’m not so hot on this one. Unless “over time” means “over decades.” Still, I don’t believe it - probably because the economists teaching my econ classes at Columbia don’t believe it.</p>
<p>But more on the event.</p>
<p>The reason why I say that Mr. Chan is bold is that he is very pragmatic in my view. Use the EU for example - “People argued for days about restructuring the EU… but I said, the rest of the world doesn’t give a damn.”</p>
<p>I have always thought that perhaps I do not “feel” much for the EU because I do not live there - but I guess I’m wrong. It’s a global phenomenon. People just don’t care. It’s like <a href="http://www.neatorama.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/american_beaver.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external">Canada</a>.</p>
<p>On the topic of Japan, Mr. Chan also stated that in a nation with a decreasing population size (i.e. a decreasing work force), the “economic growth model” becomes an “economic <em>maintenance</em> model” - and a negative growth rate should no longer be seen as a “recession.” But uh… why don’t we just look at per capita growth instead?</p>
<p>This one is also interesting - “The word ‘Chineseness’ and ‘nationalism’ are <strong>oxymorons</strong>“ - the logic within which is too deep for my ESL brain. Perhaps someone else can enlighten me as to what Mr. Chan really meant. But from what I gathered, he is basically saying that the Chinese do not actually understand what “nationalism” means - that it was always triggered by something else. But I wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the Q&amp;A session, Mr. Chan touched on the Asia Business Conference because a lady in the crowd asked whether or not he was attending as he is one of the founders. Mr. Chan said, “we don’t invite outside people to come and talk as much… we listen and learn from one another.” Indeed a very unconventional idea. Maybe I’ll incorporate part of this for <a href="http://gccglobal.org/conferences/newyork/gccday" target="_blank" rel="external">GCC Day</a>.</p>

    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">

      
      

      
        
          
            <p>As prize for winning the <a href="http://davidyzhu.wordpress.com/2010/02/27/a-great-day-of-exposure-to-the-consulting-world/" target="_blank" rel="external">Columbia Case Challenge</a>, Team Almost GS was given the opportunity to have lunch with Mr. Becker Chase from Booz &amp; Co.’s New York office. The lunch was great. Sashimi, bento box, shabu shabu - all paid for by the generous Columbia Economics Society (which receives its funding from our student life fee).</p>
<p>Turns out, Booz is very interested in China. Their <a href="www.booz.com">home page</a> tells the compelling story of a new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/China-Strategy-Harnessing-Fastest-Growing-Economy/dp/0465018254/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1266275778&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="external">“China Strategy”</a> - a worthwhile read.</p>
<p>“In the world’s fastest-growing economy, the experience of the last ten years will not be the best guide to the next ten years. Business leaders around the world who want to be successful—not just in China, but anywhere—will need a new China strategy.”</p>
<p>Indeed, a lot of this might just seem like an overly <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bull-China-Investing-Profitably-Greatest/dp/1400066166" target="_blank" rel="external">not-another-bullish-view-on-China</a> book. But the fact that the <a href="http://www.booz.com/global/home/who_we_are/leadership/40832353/edward_tse" target="_blank" rel="external">Chairman of Booz &amp; Co. Greater China</a> region is thinking in line with GCC should still be taken as an encouragement.</p>
<p>And what do you know? “Indeed, China is now the world’s largest and fastest-growing source of entrepreneurial start-ups.” Spot-on opportunity for GCC members right there. The world’s largest international student network focusing on China - and what business opportunities do our members have, if not in entrepreneurial endeavors? GCC-Vanderbilt is looking at starting a chapter initiative on doing <a href="http://tccc.us/tour-china/29-global-china-connection.html" target="_blank" rel="external">pro bono consulting work</a> in Nashville Tennessee.  GCC-Harvard is looking at bringing <a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hgcc/summer-conference-2010" target="_blank" rel="external">volunteerism to China</a>.</p>
<p>“Since 1978, China’s economic growth has been phenomenal,” the report goes on, “but also extremely inefficient.”</p>
<p><a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/lrg_official_china.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/lrg_official_china.jpeg?w=299" alt="What are the trends?" title="Ownership by Industries"></a></p>
<p>With regards to the model of business ownership, the chairman writes, “it will evolve toward a nondemocratic but market-driven form of rule that, arguably, has never been seen on the world<br>stage before.” Included is a fascinating interactive graphic of how these ownership trends are heading toward.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mr. Tse wrote on leadership - “Many Chinese officials have internalized this aspiration. They have taken on responsibilities beyond their job descriptions, acting as the guiding hand in the creation of a world-leading nation. Their interests extend beyond self-enrichment to the creation of national wealth.” This reminds me of the words of Mr. Li at Ping An Insurance during the <a href="http://davidyzhu.wordpress.com/2010/01/16/some-observations/" target="_blank" rel="external">GCC Winter Delegation</a>, “The most outstanding human capital of China are going into the political system.”</p>
<p>So all of this sounds wonderful and great. How do I get a piece of it? Becker assured me that every year, Booz tries to hire <em>at least one person</em> from Columbia. How very kind of them. I think I am better off working my ass off at Goldman Sachs this summer.</p>

Should I go? I wasn’t sure. I don’t even have a team. I thought.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">9:20a.m.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">Walked into Satow Room of Lerner in boots, jeans, and t-shirt. Lots of people - well, more than I had expected - all in suits.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">I was placed on a team. Then I was switched. Within 5 minutes I was switched again - Too many teams were missing people, and in the end it made more sense for me to be add onto a team that had a group of 3 rather than staying in a group that only had 2.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">I met Damion and Mansur for the first time. Katherine and I spoke for the first time after we have been through 5 econ electives together. I was the youngest on the team, and I liked it.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">10:00a.m.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">I changed into my routine charcoal suit and glasses. Damion’s energy level awakened my spirits. BLT and green tea by my laptop. I was ready to go.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">10:40a.m.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">The case began. Microfinance? I jot down notes as I speed-read through the packet. Where should I begin? The case was very different from Corporate Finance. No financial statements. Just a bunch of projections and statistics of competitors. Where do we begin?</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">11:15a.m.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">We finished reading the case. It took too long. I was getting worried about our progress.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">“I’m going to go ahead an put some basic info into the PowerPoint.” Having done multiple successful presentations before, I was confident with this aspect of the presentation.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">The team decided the three main challenges facing the firm: fraud, profitability, growth.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">12:00p.m.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">The team debated at length regarding the possibility of introducing technology to help cutting down overhead costs and the possibility of fraud. I glanced at the profit forecasts. No way, I said, microfinance is a volume business, with a profit margin of less than a hundredth of a percent - if we want the firm to turn profitable in 3 years, technology would suck in all the profits. I was firm. A vote confirmed my position.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">12:30p.m.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">Debate ensued on the possibility of raising labor wages. I did not want to do anything that would increase costs. How about we change the model and collect interests via banks rather than in small groups? It worked out well. Everyone agreed.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">1:00p.m.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">Time is going fast. We broke down individual recommendations into 4 sections,  with each one of the team members in charge of certain calculations, in hope that we would put them all together at the end. We squeezed a lunch break in there somewhere. I sat in the same place with the unfinished BLT.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">2:00p.m.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">Time was going faster than we expected. Our recommendations were smart, but our calculations were very basic. We had no pro forma. This is not gonna go so well, I thought.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">We had 40 minutes left. “Let’s start building the PowerPoint,” a teammate suggested. I did my usual trick - overview, projection, recommendations. Having seen a good number of presentations before, I knew simplicity was key, and audience members usually appreciate animations.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">2:40p.m.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">Productivity shot up 5x within the last ten minutes. Procrastination is part of human nature.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">We walked into the dark room. Inside, a judge sat with a notepad and a copy of the case next to him. Projector faced a whiteboard that had poor surface. Here we go. I thought.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">I opened the presentation with an overview and outlined some of the things that I felt were important. My teammates each went in depth regarding the recommendations that we made and reasoning behind each. It was a quick ten-minutes. The judge stopped us in the middle of our presentation and asked, “why lend only to women?” We gave a satisfactory answer. “Because women statistically save more and are better borrowers because they are more likely to make repayment.”</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">3:00p.m.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">The team ambled to the piano lounge. How did we do? I did not think too much about it. I do not like overestimation, nor do I like making guesses if the answer will be revealed in the next ten minutes. The team talked about how to answer some of the questions that the judge threw at us at the end. How are we going to solve the problem of hiring talent and retain them?</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">“Look!” A teammate shouted. The firm that was in the case existed in real life. We felt dumb for not having noticed before. But wait - the website confirmed that all of our recommendations were accurate. How could that be? The coincidence (or I should say, our group acumen) gave me a boost of confidence.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">3:10p.m.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">The finalists were announced. We made it. I was surprised - I had expected much harsher competition from the other team members, many of whom I knew from other student organizations. No time to think about that for now. Let’s get on with editing the PowerPoint.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">3:30p.m.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">The team practiced the presentation twice. We were going last. It meant that we had more time, but no chance of seeing the other presentations. We decided to add in a new slide to address the “talent” issue brought up by</div>

            <div id="_mcePaste"><br><div id="_mcePaste">New year celebrations continued in Chinese communities throughout the world. A record number of Chinese tourists visited Taiwan over the Lunar New Year.  A total of about 40,000 Chinese tourists are expected this year, three times more than the number of tourists for the same season last year - according to the US-China Institute at the University of Southern California.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">I remember when I was an analyst at Phillip Securities doing research, one place I looked at was the Taiwan hotel industry. Tourist hotel occupancy rate was expected to rise to 74.6% in 2009 from 64.7% in 2008 because of positive cross-Strait sentiment and policy deregulation. One concern was that report cited that the Won depreciated sharply against the yen, causing more Japanese tourists to pick Korea over Taiwan. However, if we can show that the RMB will appreciate significantly against the NT$ (likely), then tourists will also be more likely to pick Taiwan as a travel destination.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">Not included in the report was a key cultural trend between China and Taiwan – that Taiwan entertainment industry has a significant influence over Chinese pop culture – hence, deregulation will result in more travelers to Taiwan – even if they do not end up staying for days in hotels.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">Interestingly, this week Japan surpassed China as the largest holder of U.S. Treasury securities. The U.S. Treasury Department reported that China trimmed its U.S. debt holdings by $34.2 billion in December. To date, Japan holds $768.8 billion of U.S. Treasury securities while mainland China holds $755.4 billion worth of it.</div><br><div id="_mcePaste">On the sports front, China is doing much better than I expected (probably because I never paid attention to China’s winter sports development) at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. China won gold and silver in figure skating. Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo became the first ever non-European couple to win the gold medal in the Olympic pairs figure skating event. From what I understand, that was China`s first gold in figure skating history of Winter Olympic Games. But with a little bit of both Chinese and Canadian pride, I was very surprised to learn that China won Bronze medal in curling - a sport originally invented in Britain. But unsurprisingly, the Chinese team was coached by someone from Montreal - fier d’être canadien!</div><br></div>
