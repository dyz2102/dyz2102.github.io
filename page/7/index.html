            <p>During today’s practice I completed Step 5 of the Week 1 Assignments, which included making <em>is_hidden</em> a button, using a new gem called Font Awesome, adding a sidebar, and preventing users from manipulating the URL to access certain job entries.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, I completed the Font Awesome icon task first, by finding installation instructions on the Font Awesome website, I was able to follow the instruction and replacing texts in the if/then statement with Font Awesome icons.</p>
<p>I took a bit longer to solve the job#show URL prevention, but figured it out after trying out a bunch of codes from Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>When I figured out the 2 tasks above completely on my own, those were the highlights of my day.</p>
<p>For sidebar and <em>is_hidden</em> button creation, I struggled and had to seek the TA’s help. I was told there were a number of codes that we had not yet learned from the homework, and the TA sent me some codes to use for the sidebar and I referenced Xdite’s codes for the <em>is_hidden</em> button.</p>
<p>I learned the difference between .rb and .html.erb file types today, after trying to paste HTML codes into .rb files which failed. I saw some JavaScript codes available online when creating a fance sidebar (using CSS/HTML/JS together), and I look forward to trying that out in the days to come.I realize now that all these codes are working in conjunction to create the same website - they are not mutually exclusive when it comes to working on a single project.</p>
<p>I would say my mindset around solving coding issues have improved, as I now realize there is no “standard” answer in coding - there are always many different ways of achieving an effect, and it’s up to the developer to pick which method is most suitable. And what’s interesting in the coding world is that when developers find a better solution, they would often go back and replace the old solution with the new solution. This is very different from my previous profession in investment banking, where projects that are completed are often left intact because there is little possibility of going back to review what’s been done in the past.</p>

            <p>Today I completed all 4 steps of the assignment. I created a job-posting website using Rails, generated CRUD functions for job postings, and created users/admins with different levels of control.</p>
<p>When we first started, I was not sure where to start, so I naturally began by following the Medium Level Homework Assignment, replacing “group” with “job”. This worked fine for Step 1. However, by Step 2, the User Story of the job-posting site required different logic from the Discussion Forum in the homework, and I had trouble figuring out how this should work. With the help of TA, I was able to figure this out slowly by following the answer key.</p>
<p>Step 3 and 4 were like solving a puzzle. Once I got a better understanding of when to use “rails g” and “db:migrate”, I quickly solved step 3 and moved onto step 4, which was not in any of our previous homeworks and had little hint to draw from. I Googled online for usage of boolean, and decided that the checkbox was easiest to use in this case. Over the span of about 3 hours and with some assistance from the TA, I solved step 4 - best moment of my day.</p>
<p>I learned that creating a new column value requires using “rails g” and “db:migrate”, and that one cannot edit the “schema” document manually. I got a better understanding of where to look forwhat document to edit, particularly the controller.rb and views/XXX/XXX.html.erb files.</p>
<p>Today’s work was challenging, but solvable. There were a few places where, without the help of the TA, there is no way I could have figured it out (such as changing “simple_form_for @job” to “simple_form_for [:admin, @job]”). But otherwise, I believe today’s exercises were challenging but rewarding.</p>

            <p>During today’s class, we were given an overview of what to expect over the next 8 weeks. We are told that though we have the best teachers and learning materials, we will still be required to put in lots of efforts. We were given a group assignment to come up with the task list of building a basic online recruiting website, and the team went in deep discussions about priorities in terms of “must have”, “should have”, “could have”, and “nice to have” levels.</p>
<p>As I have previously run a startup in the online recruitment space, I was able to contribute actively to the discussion.</p>
<p>I learned about basic project brainstorming process and how to come up with tasks. I have also completed the assignment, learning how “forking” and “pull requests” work.</p>
<p>I will further contribute to group discussions and brainstorming sessions tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Have managed to complete Medium Pre-Course Homework while I was traveling in Europe.</p>
<p>I have managed to remember basic commands such as “rails s”, “git add .”, “git commit -m”, “rake db:migrate” etc.</p>
<p>I had trouble with Gem installations, particularly on handling “sqlite3” (I placed it between a do/end command which caused problems).</p>
<p>When everything flows and works, I felt great.</p>
<p>I learned to find files faster by remembering the first couple letters in the file locations. I learned that Gem installation is an important and tricky part of programming.</p>
<p>I will be more careful and follow instructions more closely going forward.</p>
<p>— Update —</p>

<p>Quick suggestion: In this instruction, the last line “+end” is unnecessary, because the existing code already has an “end” for the previous “do” command, so adding “end” here would create 4 “end” commands while there are only 3 “do” commands.</p>

            <p>This is my first-ever blog post as a programming student.</p>
<p>When I graduated from college 4 years ago, I never thought I’d go back to school again. I don’t dislike learning, I just think school does a terrible job simulating to the outside world. While in school, we tend to receive far more encouragements than criticisms; we tend to be placed in leadership positions based on age, seniority, or simply, lack of competition. But the outside world is very different. One begins as an entry-level employee at a very large firm, typically even bigger than most universities, faces many obligations (the heaviest of which is the financial obligation of obtaining the material possessions which we desire, the most burdensome of which include a mortgage and a car). At that point, it is too easy for one to be caught up in the midst of “life” rather than to focus on any sort of dream or larger, wildly unthinkable goals. </p>
<p>I wanted to avoid that trap. I wanted to avoid taking paths that many have taken only to find out that it doesn’t lead to where I want to be. I want to be a valuable asset to the world, not just a wealthy individual with material possessions that are only valuable because other people believe so.</p>
<p>This is why I’m signed up for this class. To learn. To try. To create.</p>

            <p>When my colleagues first found out that I was leaving banking for private equity, they congratulated me. After all, moving to the “buy-side” after 2 years of banking was something to be proud of. But when they found out I was leaving Hong Kong for Beijing, their jaws dropped. What??? Are you forreal? The air there is toxic, the food is poisonous, the traffic is suffocating, and the tax is demoralizing. What is wrong with you? Do you hate Hong Kong or something?</p>
<p>No, the truth is, I love Hong Kong. The two years I have spent in Hong Kong are probably the most carefree and purposeless fun I will ever have in my entire life. But I had to go – because something was missing in Hong Kong.</p>
<p><a href="https://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/6w1a4226.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/6w1a4226.jpg" alt="6w1a4226"></a></p>
<p><em>67/F Cheung Kong Center, where I have spent longer hours starring at a computer screen than my entire pre-work life combined.</em></p>
<p>No, I’m not talking about the work experience of pumping out models and PowerPoint slides like a machine around the clock, or the deal experience of closing cross-border M&amp;A’s to earn bragging rights among fellow bankers, or the travel experience of flying business class with corporate executives from New York and London.</p>
<p>I’m talking about living the Hong Kong-style life, under the neon lights of <em>Lan Kwai Fong</em>, about the materialistic life that makes living and breathing the Hong Kong experience a young bachelor’s must-have in a lifetime. When I boarded flight Delta 173 on August 17<sup><span style="font-size:small;">th</span></sup>, 2012 from JFK to HKG, the city with the highest concentration of Rolls Royce’s and the most tall buildings in the world, I knew it was time to lay off the gas pedal and just enjoy the ride.</p>
<p><a href="https://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_3779.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_3779.jpg" alt="img_3779"></a></p>
<p><em>Grand opening party of a new club in LKF, the name of which I can no longer recall. The club closed within a year.</em></p>
<p>As affluent Hong Kongers are some of the world’s best practitioners of hedonism, you will find yourself quickly blending in the Hong Kong lifestyle around happy hours, dinners, boat trips, birthday parties and other forms of wine &amp; dine experiences. You go from ordinary food establishments like Tsui Wah and SimplyLife to private kitchens and Michelin stars; you start to turn down tourist bars along LKF hill in favor of whiskey bars, cigar bars, sheesha bars, ice bars, dining-in-the-dark restaurant &amp; bars, liquid nitrogen ice cream bars, your friend’s bars, your friend’s friend’s bars, and so on. If you can think of it, it’s there in HK. You find dining &amp; entertainment expenses escalating over your rent in almost no time (particularly if you are male, the gender which always pays). Slowly, your spare capacity goes from planning your life as a great [<span style="color:#c00000;"><em>insert dream here</em><span style="color:#333333;">]</span></span> to planning your next fancy dinner, your next epic weekend, your next marvelous holiday, your next fabulous birthday party… and the list goes on.</p>
<p><a href="https://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/853914786.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/853914786.jpg" alt="853914786"></a></p>
<p><em>Probably the best city view in the world.</em></p>
<p>Gradually, the comfort and safety of Hong Kong bring you what you’ve always desired – <em><strong>the pure enjoyment of life itself, <span class="s2">without having to feel sorry about it because everyone around you is doing the exact same</span></strong></em>. You don’t see the negativities of society anymore around you. Poverty doesn’t show its faces, crime doesn’t come near you, pollution isn’t broadcasted as a social problem, food safety is almost guaranteed, healthcare services are among the best in the world, and tax is definitely not getting any complaints – if utopia existed, it would look something like Hong Kong Central.</p>
<p>But once you’ve spent long enough time here, you will see that Hong Kong is a <em>concrete jungle</em> not only for its buildings and underground tunnels, but also for <em>zero social mobility</em>. The resulting social structure under these circumstances is not one where everyone is talking about the global power dynamics, debating the benefits and harms of creative destruction, pondering the philosophical nature of the human existence, or even whispering the future of democracy. No. That is not Hong Kong. At least not the Hong Kong I have experienced. Living in Hong Kong as an expat is much more like attending the grand parties of the <em>Great Gatsby__,</em> where the crème of the crop of the Ivy League and Oxbridge graduates proudly settle in the most fit-and-proper professions ranging from doctors, lawyers, accountants, to bankers and civil servants, toasting and celebrating the greatness of their own achievements.</p>
<p><a href="https://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_7866.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_7866.jpg" alt="img_7866"></a></p>
<p><em>Magnum, where film “Lan Kwai Fong” was filmed. Magnum Entertainment listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in January 2014. The offering was over 3000 times oversubscribed. Currently shares trade 50% below its first week’s performance.</em></p>
<p>But the most mercenary aspect of Hong Kong is the ease of leaving her. During SARS, those who could leave disserted the city and made it a ghost town almost overnight. In the 1990’s (think 89 and 97), those who could afford to emigration in Hong Kong have all obtained foreign passports, with Vancouver being one of the favorite destinations – and the reason behind my conversational Cantonese having grown up there.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, in this sad existence, is Mr. Gatsby himself. If he dies, no one will be staying for the funeral, because his guests are busy and have got other parties to catch.</p>
<p>Admittedly, for the better part of my 2 years in Hong Kong, I was one of them. I lived my life as a guest in Mr. Gatzby’s party, and I gave my love to every moment I have spent inside his doors. I have been there, standing in the VIP areas of Dragon-I/Volar/Levels/Magnum, on the floor, on the table, on the stage, feeling like I’m with the most important people in the entire world. I have been there, dropping my entire month’s salary hosting parties and treating friends ranging from my future best man to someone I have never even met and will never meet again. I have been there, posting photos of drinking and partying festivities on Facebook to gain popularity and social status, making acquaintances so numerous that deleting them all would probably be faster if I got a new phone and reinstalled Whatsapp.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. There are plenty of very successful people in Hong Kong who have found the right balance to achieve happiness across the spectrum of one’s life desires. But your 20’s is meant to be spent in a way to maximize your potentials, and the <strong>24/7 work-party-sleep cycle</strong> isn’t exactly “maximizing” - it’s in fact “burning”, eating away the fuel and the drive to reach the dreams you once had.</p>
<p><a href="https://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_1383.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="https://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_1383.jpg" alt="img_1383"></a></p>
<p><em>After an all-nighter at the printer for a company’s IPO. Long hours typically result in a binary lifestyle swinging between extreme work and extreme play.</em></p>
<p>So as one of the most junior attendees of Mr. Gatsby’s great parties, I have chosen to walk away. After all, what is the point of devoting my most productive years to a grand party, only to be handed another glass of champagne, gazing upward to tycoons who will always be tycoons, and dancing alongside white-collars who will always be white-collars. Leaving Hong Kong was not because it was destroying my body or polluting my mind, but because it was killing who I could be.</p>

            <p>Some say I have abandoned this blog. I have not. I constantly think about what I want to post here, share here, and have started many drafts that were never complete. It takes a big chunk of time to generate the focus that will result in a good post, and as I have come to learn, while it is possible for a banking analyst to make time to balance out work and play, allocating that additional few precious hours to sit in front of a computer to write is much harder when you’ve already sat in front of a computer for the most part of a 24-hr day.</p>
<p>So here we are, capitalizing on the Chinese New Year break, blackberry-free and too lazy to move after consecutive nights of festivities having consumed as much food and liquor as my body could handle without getting sick, I am ready to share the snapshot of my 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Leaving Columbia and NYC</strong></p>
<p>2012 was an important year for me. Originally the class of 2011, I took a <a href="http://davidyzhu.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/252/" title="Closing Up the “Gap Year” Chapter" target="_blank" rel="external">gap year</a> and moved my seat to the class of 2012. Many people asked me what it was like to be back in school again. It felt like <em>home</em>. Like how you leave home for a year to school and return for the first time in 12 months. And like returning home after a long year abroad, I became more appreciative of what being in school had to offer and came to appreciate my <em>alma mater</em>. Learning was more fun (but only on a relative basis compare to previous semesters), because I finally had some real life experiences to convince myself the things I was learning were relevant. While the typical senior year results in borderline F’s and increased risk of alcoholism, I did better than any previous semester and forged new friendships based more so on common interests rather than social cliques.</p>
<p>But however nice school was, my mind had already felt like I was a graduate. <em>Home,</em> metaphorically or actually, was never a place where I dwelled extensively. Exactly a year ago, I finished my degree and came back to China to take part in starting a local VC/PE shop in China, in search of the kind of experience that I knew I’d never get once I set foot on the sacred pilgrimage of bulge bracket investment banking.</p>
<p>In May, I returned to NYC for the graduation ceremony. In June, I returned to NYC one more time for the global IBD training. When I boarded Delta 173 at JFK on August 17th, 2012, I knew I had ran out of degrees of freedom to go back to the greatest city in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Asia - the Here and Now</strong></p>
<p>During my college years, most of the ambitious college students with Chinese heritage have a China dream of sorts. Some chose to put those dreams to action right away, while others chose to gain more experiences abroad before returning. Having left China at the age of 10, and having engaged with a serious group of like-minded individuals through <a href="http://www.gccglobal.org" target="_blank" rel="external">GCC</a>, I simply did not have the patience to be part of the second group.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is a unique place. It’s filled with more exclusive clubs and associations than any other city I’ve lived in, and the whole city itself seems to be built on the elements of capitalism: consumerism, materialism, elitism, pragmatism - doesn’t sound like the most friendly place to live in the world, but there is upside. The combination of early exposure to capitalism, a small geographic area, dense population, and the Hong Kong people’s desire for achievements and global recognition has created one of the most efficient cities ever built by mankind. The most advanced mobile technology, transportation systems, public infrastructure, low-cost of domestic helpers and the simple close-proximity of everything spoil the expats here  to consider almost every other city in the world, <em>inconvenient</em>. And I have, for better or worse, become one of them.</p>
<p>As one can imagine, not everyone likes it this way. I am not short of friends who have shied away from Hong Kong because of its culture and the difficulties involved in adjusting to this city because of the challenge of Cantonese, the jaw-dropping rent (usually followed by varying degrees of claustrophobia) or a combination of all of the above. Luckily, having learned to appreciate Cantonese culture since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVB" target="_blank" rel="external">TVB</a> was available in China in the 90’s, and growing up in the beautiful <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hongcouver" target="_blank" rel="external">Hong-couver</a>, I saw no challenge in the language or culture.</p>
<p>Though I’ve always been interested in Hong Kong, the firmness of my decision to work in Hong Kong was purely a result of my <a href="http://davidyzhu.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/252/" title="Closing Up the “Gap Year” Chapter" target="_blank" rel="external">gap year</a>. I saw first-hand the types of opportunities that were available to young graduates in PRC, where the training of new grads never seems to make it to the top of CEOs’ agenda, I knew it was better to start in a more cosmopolitan environment with 1. English as the main working language and 2. a high degree of efficiency from mobile services to elevators to public transportations and 3. access to a great diversity of people. And Hong Kong has all three -  always has, always will.</p>
<p>When I landed in HKG at 11pm on Aug 18th, 2012, I was on familiar ground.</p>
<p>Everyone of us desired our China dream. And here’s mine.</p>

            <p>2012年6月3日下午8：57分</p>
<p><strong>台中往台北高铁</strong></p>
<p>为了参加Renet的活动，有生以来第一次来到台湾，乘坐着台中往台北的高铁，静静思考着过去几天对台湾的印象。第一次来台湾，也只是待了短短的5天，所以只能仅凭一点主观的观察描述一下微观的社会。听着周杰伦的《青花瓷》，深深感受到海峡的另一端生活的人，是如何在多个方面保持着比我眼中的中国更中国的传统和美德。</p>
<p>刚到台北，从机场出来后第一个跟我聊天的是机场出租车的司机。他的礼貌、谈吐，都让我对台湾的印象足以打满分。当然，台北市政府对于机场接机出租车的管理也是出奇的严格。所有的车必须是最多开过2年的新车，因为新车安全性较好，而如果受到客户投诉的话会自动停牌2-7天，投诉3次送往行检局，入行检局2次就会被彻底开除。</p>
<p>在台中等列车时，轻轻的风，蓝蓝的天，但可能最让我难忘的，是台中高铁站月台的<em><strong>静</strong></em>。静到可以听到鸟叫，听到风从耳边穿过，听到那么几个行人的脚步声。的确，台湾人不喜欢大吵大闹，这一点从故宫博物馆里穿梭于游客之中的高举着“禁止大声喧哗”手牌的工作人员的表情里就可以看得出来。台北的捷运上更是静得出奇，仿佛如果开口说话就是在打扰别人，打破每一个公共场合应有的，几乎神圣的peacefulness。</p>
<p>站在台中高铁站的月台，有种回到家的感觉。</p>
<p>台湾的服务人员，无论是企业的还是政府的，都给我留下了礼貌到极致的印象。有时，“谢谢”的回答不是“不客气”而是另一句“谢谢”。我感谢你帮助了我，而你感谢我让你有了帮助我的机会。再高尚的美德不过如此简单。中国的每一种权利都在过去的30年中被金钱化，而在台湾，权利是一种荣誉，是选民给予每一个政客的机会，而滥用这个机会的人即会得到应有的惩罚。陈水扁的案例再清楚不过。</p>
<p><span style="font-size:13px;">在心理学中，能够区分后天环境和先天基因对人类影响的就是研究一对双胞胎。因为他们的基因一样，所以他们长大后的所有差异都来自于外界对他们的影响。同样的，如果要研究中华民族到底能否做的更好，怎样做得更好，台湾和大陆得对比可以说类同于心理学上对一对双胞胎的研究。</span></p>
<p>人对人和蔼可亲的态度，对他人的基本尊重以及对自己的基本要求，都让我感到很惊讶 - 海峡两岸的两个孪生兄弟，怎么在100年间差距可以拉的这么远。</p>
<p>是，台北比我想像当中要破很多，它的楼房大多都很旧，而且高楼大厦要远远少于香港、上海、北京，甚至连武汉的高楼都要多过台北。但一个国家治理的好与坏不是靠它楼宇的高低密度而决定，一个民族的幸福也不是靠它的GDP增长率来衡量。的确，台湾的经济不如从前，越来越多的“世界第一”和“亚洲第一”逐渐被大陆和其他的竞争对手所取代，公民的团结意识也消磨在缺乏主导思想的民主政治的诋毁和谩骂声中。但一个国家的未来为什么要和多个“世界第一”密切相关？国际关系并不是一场谁拿第一的游戏，尽管大部分人在投票的时候难免受到某种盲目的爱国主义的干扰。</p>
<p>幸福与否，大多数取决于信仰、信念，而非物质。一个永远不会满足的民族，自然永远不会幸福；一个得到足够就很满足的民族，自然很容易就会幸福。</p>
<p>所以我眼中的台湾人，很礼貌，很幸福。</p>

            <p>A while back, a friend of mine posted an article from the Esquire on his Facebook titled “<a href="http://www.esquire.com/features/young-people-in-the-recession-0412" target="_blank" rel="external">The War Against Youth</a>“ (in America). I got interested and had a few thoughts on the same problem in a Chinese context.</p>
<p>[caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”460”]<a href="http://www.esquire.com/features/young-people-in-the-recession-0412" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://www.esquire.com/cm/esquire/images/NC/esq-chart-01-0412-lg.jpg" alt=""></a> Graphic from Esquire.com[/caption]</p>
<p>The article argued that “[n]obody ever talks about generational conflicts,” because it’s difficult to bring up. I disagree. Americans are too liberal and too vocal to shy away from bringing up anything that they think is worth arguing for. The fundamental problem of the lack of discussion in inter-generational conflicts is that people of different generations tend to think of each other as <em>in-group members as opposed to out-group members</em>. For instance, I would place my father within my “group” rather than an opposing group when considering things like “class conflicts.” We are much more likely to group together and fight for common interests based on race, ethnicity, nationality, and geographic regions than by age or generations. But inter-generational conflict <em>exists</em>. Because in general, the <em>older</em> you get, the <em>more</em> you make and the <em>less</em> you have to work for it.</p>
<p>The fact that you make more as you get older is pretty intuitive, because you build up experiences and expertise through years of work. But the proportion at which this gap exists should also make sense. Not in the US. “In 1984, American breadwinners who were 65 and over made <strong>10 times</strong> as much as those under 35. The year Obama took office, older Americans made almost <strong>47 times</strong> as much as the younger generation…” A jump from 10x to 47x in the span of 24 years. How did that happen? Did older people contribute more and more during this time? Or did experience become more and more valuable?</p>
<p>If asked which one is more important for the nation, I think most people would agree that education is of a higher priority than Medicare. But money says otherwise. “The federal government spends $480 billion on Medicare and $68 billion on education… Across the board, the money flows <strong>not to helping the young grow up, but helping the old die comfortably</strong>.” According to a 2009 Brookings Institution study, “The United States spends 2.4 times as much on the elderly as on children, measured on a per capita basis, with the ratio rising to 7 to 1 if looking just at the federal budget.” This may be caused partly by the fact that 1. it costs more to keep people alive than to put kids through school and 2. the US population is aging as baby-boomers retire.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the lives of the young Chinese graduating from college. For their entire lives, grades have been the only thing that mattered to get to the top. The most successful students of China are the best at memorization and test-taking. Yet what lies ahead after graduation is one of the most complex and political worlds imaginable. Their skill-sets, mastery of test-taking and problem-solving, are of little to no help. But this is only one of many difficulties lying ahead for them. From <em>education</em> to<em> on-the-job training</em>, from the <em>job markets</em> to<em> culture</em>, nothing helps the Chinese youth - except maybe their parents who can and are willing to.</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong> - The Chinese education system is <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/chinas-education-prepares-students-tests/story?id=12348599#.T3aOxOyomBc" target="_blank" rel="external">widely acknowledged to inhibit students from developing a creative mind and face real world problems</a>. The One-Child Policy only exacerbated the problem by allowing grandparents to treat their only grandson or granddaughter as their “bao bei” (“precious”) and not allowing them to encounter any type of hardship from childhood through adulthood. Many children from affluent families end up finding jobs through family connections, and those from low-income families with no solid connections often take up low-wage entry-level jobs in manufacturing or services. Still, with all the funding poured into education, “[a] McKinsey study found that 44 percent of executives in Chinese companies reported that insufficient talent limited their global ambitions.” To make matter worse, “According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the average college graduate earns just 300 yuan – roughly $45 – more than average migrant worker [per month],” which explains why so many rural students choose to drop out of school and begin work early rather finishing their zero-value education.</p>
<p><strong>On-the-Job Training</strong> - Having experience working in Beijing, Hong Kong, and New York, I can speak to this from my personal experience - on-the-job training in China is pretty bad. How bad it is will really depend on what type of company you work for. But the point is not just a general lack of formal training programs, but also a lack of mentorship and professional developmental networks. How much people are willing to help you really depends on what you have to offer in return. This makes it very difficult for ordinary young professionals to move up because all they have to offer initially is pure physical labor. Without quickly assemble resources and figure out how to utilize everything around you, you may find yourself stuck at the bottom of the food-chain with no end in sight.</p>
<p><strong>Job Market -</strong> State-owned enterprises dominate the job market; jobs at state-owned monopolies in fields like oil &amp; gas, telecom, and financial services are among the most coveted careers in China. But they are nothing like corporations and private enterprises. In SOEs it is generally understood that the longer you stay, the more power you have and the more income you generate. But doing the most work doesn’t necessarily make you last the longest; staying out of trouble does. Therefore, there is little that a young person can do in an SOE other than to wait, and the incentives against innovation create some of the world’s largest “dinosaur companies.” Below is how an SOE <a href="http://www.douban.com/group/topic/28543215/" target="_blank" rel="external">entry-level employee described her situation</a> online:</p>
<p>“工作，我们俩都是在国企，都是那种稳定到死的，在各自家里看来，如果要辞职就是脑子有病。在工作初期家里都是花了银子托了关系的，家里完全不赞同辞职。而且是双方家里都是这情况！ 但说实话，我们俩对自己的工作都不是很满意，没什么前途，就是熬日子，国企基本都这样。”</p>
<p>“In terms of jobs, my boyfriend and I both work at SOEs, the most stable type possible. In the view of both of our families, we’d be retarded to quit and try something else. In order to get these jobs our families both had to pay people money and find connections, which is why they don’t agree when we told them we wanted to quit. What makes it worse is that my boyfriend and I are in the exact same situation! Honestly speaking, we are both not satisfied with our jobs, there’s no future. The only thing to do is sit there and get by the days - SOEs are basically all the same.”</p>
<p>Today, even lesser-known SOEs require some guanxi to get in, and the better-known ones (usually monopolies) may cost you both guanxi as well as money, as is the case above. A job at CCTV may costs you a few thousand US dollars; a job as a stewardess for Air China may be double that. That is if you already <em>have</em> the necessary qualifications for these positions. This shows that people would rather wait for years for higher-level income than taking any risks in the more competitive non-SOE markets.</p>
<p>Below, we can see that as of 2010, seven out of fifteen of the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2011/performers/companies/biggest/" target="_blank" rel="external">world’s largest employers</a> are Chinese SOE’s. This is not counting the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17429786" target="_blank" rel="external">2.3 million peopled hired by the PLA</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Reality</strong> - In my <a href="http://davidyzhu.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/252/" title="Closing Up the “Gap Year” Chapter" target="_blank" rel="external">earlier post</a>, I talked about how “[i]n the West, youth is good. Youth is energy, opportunities, and possibilities. But in China, youth is immaturity. It equates to inexperience, which to most people screams unreliability (i.e. 不靠谱).” But you can’t blame people for believing this. Younger professionals often quit without notifying his/her boss, steal corporate contacts and other confidential information, or just have a lack of commitment in general. This creates a vicious cycle when society doesn’t help young people which forces them to break more rules and make them seem even more unreliable.</p>
<p>The gerontocratic nature of China’s government and SOE systems is largely a matter of political legacy, and a common legacy of most states with a powerful central government. All of China’s presidents took power at age 60+, with some remaining in power until death. In comparison, Obama took office when he was 48, and no one really cares where Bush or Clinton is.</p>
<p>The older generation of Chinese are sitting on anywhere between 10-30 years of savings, and many receive retirement compensations at a rate of RMB1000+/month (equivalent of minimum wage at a small second-tier city in China) and enjoyed a huge boost from the housing boom if they owned any property from 2005-2009. But keep in mind that elderly people are generally married (income x2), have no mortgage (housing often taken care of by the SOEs from the communist era), lower spending habits, and money from their children, with medical care as their highest area of spending. The younger Chinese on the other hand, must pay for mortgage in post-housing-boom China (if they want to get married and move out), spend more on social and leisure activities, take care of the children’s education (a rising cost), and sometimes take care of the elderly parents.</p>
<p>While it’s true that when older generations pass away, they often pass down all their assets to their children (a source of conflicts in many Chinese families between siblings), but with inflation at 5-6% per annum (and far more so at the most metropolitan areas), the middle-aged Chinese are feeling squeezed, and the younger Chinese graduating from college simply see no light at the end of the tunnel. Unlike in the US, where college grads are pretty much on their own, Chinese parents are often willing to take care of their children for as long as they can.</p>
<p>This makes some people’s lives easier, but it creates another huge problem - the inequality of opportunities. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/05/inequality_china" target="_blank" rel="external">A research paper from 2010</a> found that, in China, “richer parents helped a person’s prospects (a 10% increment in parental income was reflected in a 4.5% income boost for their offspring) and having parents who were <em>employed by the state</em> helped a lot. Parental education, on the other hand, was <em>no help whatsoever</em>. In these provinces, where your parent works matters more than where he went to school” (italics added).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>How to End this War</strong></span></p>
<p>A few bright spots that might materially shift the dynamics in this “War Against Youth” may be the privatization of state monopolies, the growing service industry, and the IT industry. Baidu, for example, <a href="http://ir.baidu.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=188488&amp;p=irol-SECText&amp;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2lyLmludC53ZXN0bGF3YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2RvY3VtZW50L3YxLzAwMDExOTMxMjUtMTItMTM5Nzg5L3htbA%3d%3d#tx243699_10" target="_blank" rel="external">employs over 16,000 people</a> and with an <a href="http://www.ixwebhosting.mobi/li-baidu-average-age-of-employees-26-year-olds-opportunities/" target="_blank" rel="external">average age of 26</a>. There are also countless number of jobs created via various start-ups in e-commerce, social media, and other forms of online innovation.</p>
<p>China’s current leaders may still be under the influences from China’s turbulent past, but a commitment toward a more open society, starting from the top, may usher in a new era of explosive development through deregulation and innovation. At least that is what we hope for.</p>
<p>If the above sound all too serious, here’s some comedy relief. Watch <a href="http://familyguy.wikia.com/wiki/Trading_Places" target="_blank" rel="external">this episode</a> of Family Guy, where Chris and Meg Griffin traded place with Peter and Lois, only to realize that it’s not easy to be kids or parents, and enjoy a good laugh!</p>
