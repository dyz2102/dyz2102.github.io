            <p>The title of this post is inspired by the well-known investment book, _A Random Walk Down Wall Street _by Burton G. Malkiel (1973). I’ve never read the book, but the idea that Malkiel tried to convey is pretty easy to summarize:</p>
<p><em>Since stock prices cannot be predicted in the short term, argues Malkiel, individual investors are better off buying and holding onto index funds than meddling with securities or actively managing mutual funds. Not only will a broad range of index funds outperform a professionally managed portfolio in the long run, but investors can avoid expense charges and trading costs, which decrease returns.</em> <em>[…] His witty, acerbic style and persuasive arguments will delight readers but, alas, leave Wall Street unmoved.</em></p>

            <p>At 4:11pm today, I received an email from the University entitled “Security Alert 11.12.11”. Below is the email message:</p>
<p><a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-16-at-12-02-02-am.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/screen-shot-2011-11-16-at-12-02-02-am.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2011-11-16 at 12.02.02 AM"></a></p>
<p><em>We have been notified by the NYPD, that on November 12, 2011 at about 7:30 p.m. two males were the victim of an attempted robbery in the lobby of a brownstone on W. 114 St. between Broadway and Amsterdam Ave. The suspect […] was sitting on the steps of the brownstone and followed the first victim into the hallway. He displayed a gun and demanded the victim’s I-phone [sic]. When the victim stated he didn’t have an I-phone, the male gave it back to him. The second victim entered the hallway and the suspect demanded his Iphone. Once again the suspect handed it back when he found out it was not actually an Iphone. The suspect left the building and fled on foot down Amsterdam Ave.</em></p>
<p>For your information, “W. 114th St. between Broadway and Amsterdam Ave.” is exactly where I live. The robbery might as well have taken place in my building.</p>
<p>This is about the third or forth crime reported this year around the school, but I am particularly shocked at this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/iphone_4.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/iphone_4.png" alt="" title="iphone_4"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The robber was already pointing a gun at somebody, committing a crime, and left empty-handed because the phone wasn’t an iPhone. He basically said no to the watch (~$120), no to the TI-83 (~$100), no to the laptop (~$1000+), no to the iPod (~$200), no to non-smart phones (~$100), and no to every other smartphone ever invented besides the iPhone!</p>
<p>I’m not sure if I should be laughing at his failed criminal act or admiring his steadfastness to the iPhone. Steve Jobs would be proud. Perhaps secretly.</p>
<p>Regardless of how I resolve my cognitive dissonance, if you have an iPhone, consider putting it back in the box and take out that Blackberry you retired from last year.</p>
<p>Watch out RIM, here’s your chance.</p>
<p>(Not really.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Update Nov. 21, 2011:</p>
<p>You’ve got to be kidding me. This guy (or his good friend) came back!</p>
<p>Security Alert today:</p>
<p><em>On November 21, 2011 at about 11:50 p.m., a student was the victim of an attempted robbery on W.114St. between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. The student accompanied by another person was accosted as she was walking on the north side of W.114 St. towards Broadway. The suspect pushed the victim against a fence, threatened her and demanded her I-phone [sic]. When the suspect learned she did not have an I- phone, he fled east towards Amsterdam Avenue without taking any property. The suspect is observed on video walking back and forth on W. 114 St. prior to the crime. Moments earlier, he followed a student into Ruggles Hall but left the building immediately. If you have any information about this crime or this suspect, contact the 26Pct Detective Unit at 212-__678-1351 or contact the undersigned. If you observe this person on the street, call the police immediately by dialing 911.</em></p>
<p>The incident is so serious that the University’s VP Public Safety wrote a letter addressing this issue:</p>
<p><em>In the past few weeks you have received several Security Alerts regarding crimes in our community. In particular, there has been a series of robberies and attempted robberies on W. 114th Street. I am writing to let you know that the safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff, as well as others in our community, is our top priority. I would also like to share with you some of the things that the Department of Public Safety is doing to safeguard our campus, and the 114th Street area in particular, in order to help allay any concerns that you may have on the issue of safety here at Columbia…
</em></p>
<p>I’m looking forward to the “iPhones Cause Crimes on Ivy League Campus” article in the next edition of the New York Times.</p>

One reason is that China is a <strong>shame-based society</strong>, very different from the <strong>guilt-based West</strong>. In the West, with society’s religious orientation, many controls are internalized. Guilt, which is ultimately the fear of sin and eternal damnation, puts a check on bad behavior. In China, it is the fear of exposure and the accompany shame that tarnishes the entire extended family. As a result, the Chinese can feel pretty good about doing almost anything as long as they don’t get caught. In that atmosphere, the only efficient form of law and order is a strong and omnipresent government that increases the likelihood of getting caught if you do something wrong.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>One Billion Customers (McGregor, 2005)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we borrow McGregor’s frame and project it onto a gross generalization of the whole Chinese population and all of their possible actions, it is a scary thought that people aren’t killing each other and stealing each other’s money only because they don’t want to be caught doing so.</p>
<p>An equally depressing <a href="http://the-diplomat.com/china-power/2011/10/20/chen-xianmei%E2%80%99s-tragedy/" target="_blank" rel="external">blogger</a> concluded that “China seems to have become <strong>so utilitarian</strong> that it can’t understand or even tolerate people who do things for <strong>altruistic reasons</strong>“ (emphasis added).</p>
<p>But even with an ultra-utilitarian system, not everyone’s sociopathic or else we wouldn’t have the society we have today. Altruism isn’t nonexistent in China, and utilitarianism isn’t the main problem. The Chinese may be overtly obsessed with money and wealth, but even that doesn’t warrant the actions witnessed in the first video.</p>
<p>The problem, in my opinion, is <strong>trust</strong>. And there is none.</p>
<p>Chinese cities are infiltrated with deceptive and malicious schemes aimed straight at your wallet: phone calls, texts, and even strangers calling for “help.” This accompanied by the media whose job is to sell these stories that keep people on their feet. Take a look at <a href="http://beat.baidu.com/?p=2534" target="_blank" rel="external">Baidu’s Top Ten search items</a> daily and you’ll learn what catches the Chinese people’s attention - <strong>not</strong> how to make money (surprise!), but what to <strong>watch-out for</strong> in China: <a href="http://tech.ifeng.com/internet/detail_2011_11/08/10497814_0.shtml" target="_blank" rel="external">poisonous food &amp; beverages</a>, <a href="http://news.southcn.com/c/2011-11/04/content_32598689.htm" target="_blank" rel="external">corrupt government officials</a>, <a href="http://sichuan.scol.com.cn/gaxw/content/2011-11/07/content_3076734.htm?node=945" target="_blank" rel="external">ineffective legal system</a>, <a href="http://sichuan.scol.com.cn/gaxw/content/2011-11/07/content_3076734.htm?node=945" target="_blank" rel="external">natural disasters</a>, <a href="http://www.51wan.com/z/201111/84655.html" target="_blank" rel="external">prostitution</a>, even <a href="http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2011-11-06/040623421149.shtml" target="_blank" rel="external">random stranger stealing your new-born child from the hospital</a>. Scared? Me too.</p>
<p>There are few Good Samaritans in China not because people have no faith or belief or have lost their souls, but because the Good Samaritans have either been tricked in the past or have heard too many horror stories to maintain their confidence in strangers.</p>
<p>The basic rule to survival, as anyone who has traveled the country would quickly learn, is to not trust anyone. People are constantly living in an environment where they feel unsafe. It didn’t need to be a 2-year-old girl; it could’ve been a full-grown adult lying there. People would need to start gathering around him, starring from a distance, muttering conjectures in each other’s ears; finally, when enough people have gathered around to make it feel “safe,” when it feels like there are enough witnesses and no one is going to hold you responsible for what has happened, someone might jump in and do the right thing - help. That’s typically what you’d see if someone is dying on the streets in China. Populated streets with many pedestrians.</p>
<p>In China, you can expect help from a friend, a colleague, a distant relative, or anyone that has the slightest knowledge of who you are or who you might be. But don’t expect the help of a stranger.</p>

            <p><strong>The Scare</strong></p>
<p>I was in Philadelphia two weekends ago, when Occupy Wall Street  had just popped up on my laptop screen for a few days. I was attending an info session for GCC-UPenn and was about to head back to New York. I was in a suit and carried a briefcase.</p>
<p>I was buying a bottle of green tea at the bus stop stand when the guy, after ignoring me for a full 30 seconds chatting with his friends, offered me $18 for the bottle. I startled. He laughed and said it was only $2. He then checked me up and down and asked his friends, “How much do you think this guy makes? $300k a year?” He turned toward me. “Ain’t that right? $300,000?” I paused. At this point I think my sympathetic nervous system was fully at work.</p>
<p>In the interest of self-protection, I said, “No I’m still a student looking for a job, that’s why I’m dressed like this.” Not far from the truth. At least not as far as the difference between 300k and however much I might be making if I were actually working right now. Did I look <em>that</em> old? Or did he just have no idea how much men-in-suits typically  make?</p>
<p>Blame me for being overly sensitive but, I’ve wore a suit in the US since 10th grade MUN conferences, and this was the first time that I felt a bit threatened because of it.</p>
<p><strong>The Interview Room</strong></p>
<p>A few days later, a friend of mine went into an interview and was asked a question about Occupy Wall Street.</p>
<p>“So what do you think of the protest?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s a big waste of time. These people should spend their time and energy finding a job instead,” the interviewee said.</p>
<p>Lucky for him, the interviewer actually<strong> felt the same way</strong>. But such response is far too risky at a sensitive time like this. What if you met someone who liked everything in politically correct terms?</p>
<p>And if <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2011/10/occupy-wall-street-spreads-worldwide/100171/" target="_blank" rel="external">this article</a> from last week’s <em>the Atlantic</em> didn’t convince you to never mention “money” as one of your motivations during interview, I don’t know what will.</p>
<p><strong>What This Mean to You</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not Occupy Wall Street ever took place, people in finance are going to be making less in the foreseeable future. <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/312639" target="_blank" rel="external">Banks are already downsizing their risks as well as number of employees</a>. To borrow from <a href="mergersandinquisitions.com">Mergers &amp; Inquisitions</a>‘s <a href="http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/wall-street-hate/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=wall-street-hate" target="_blank" rel="external">recent blog on Occupy Wall Street</a>, “nowadays people go into Wall Street _expecting _to get rich, whereas in the 1980s they went to Wall Street <em>hoping</em> to get rich.” So if anything, the recent protest should really make those who are still “thinking” about going into finance to really dig deep and examine the core motivations behind their career choices.</p>
<p>And when all else fail to answer your inquiries - <a href="http://davidyzhu.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/252/" target="_blank" rel="external">take a gap year</a>.</p>

            <p>So the recent <a href="http://occupywallst.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Occupy Wall Street</a> movement got me curious to look into what percentage of people at Columbia go into finance. I flipped through the CCE (Columbia’s <a href="http://www.careereducation.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="external">Center for Career Education</a>) website to see if they’ve got this sheet of statistic on where Columbia students end up working after graduation. It turns out they still have it. And the numbers have escaped me since I last saw them back in 2007 during my CCE orientation as a freshman…</p>
<p><strong>Part I - The Stats</strong></p>
<p>[scribd id=68593382 key=key-2isb1kv49lqd5yfid7dg mode=list]</p>
<p>An astonishing 24.9% of the Class of 2010 in CC and SEAS ended up working in financial services, with an additional 9.1% in consulting. SEAS graduate programs yield a whopping 32.9% for finance and 9.2% for consulting. (For a school as specialized as “engineering,” this could almost warrant a change in the school’s name.)</p>
<p>[scribd id=68598346 key=key-l7oxppvyik4vsv7wo2l mode=list]</p>
<p>Now I got really curious and, before we begin to judge Columbia, let’s take a look at <a href="http://www.ocs.fas.harvard.edu/students/jobs/seniorsurvey.htm" target="_blank" rel="external">Harvard</a>.</p>
<p>[caption id=”attachment_324” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”Source: Seniors Survey, Office of Career Services, Harvard University”]<a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/screen-shot-2011-10-13-at-4-03-21-am.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/screen-shot-2011-10-13-at-4-03-21-am.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2011-10-13 at 4.03.21 AM"></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>On the Charles River, over the past five years, we see a few trends: smaller percentage of students in finance/consulting, fewer in military, more in non-profit, health/medicine, communications/media/arts, and business (presumably this is where entrepreneurship would fall).</p>
<p>Since we don’t have trend data by industry for Columbia, it’s hard to make trend comparisons. But just taking the 2010 data alone, 33% of Harvard seniors planned to work in finance or consulting - almost at the same level as Columbia’s 34% (though showing a noticeable difference where consulting firms historically have a stronger preference for Harvard than Columbia). At its height, <strong>47% of Harvard seniors planned to work in finance or consulting in 2008</strong> <strong>(just before the financial crisis)</strong>. I’d assume Columbia’s 2008 numbers were probably similar.</p>
<p>You can check out <a href="http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/careerservices/undergrad/reports.html" target="_blank" rel="external">UPenn</a>, <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/career/undergrads/student-survey-data/" target="_blank" rel="external">Princeton</a>, and <a href="http://www.career.cornell.edu/surveysAndSalary/postgrad.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Cornell</a>.</p>
<p>So I’ve been asked this many times and have wondered this myself - <em><strong>why do so many students from top universities end up in finance or consulting</strong></em>?</p>
<p>Here’s my take on why.</p>
<p><strong>Part II - The Qualitative Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Let’s admit it - for most of us, we have <em>no</em> idea of what we want to do after college. For starters, we all know that this campus is skewed toward finance and consulting (because that’s all that we hear about) - but for the average-over-achieving-Ivy-Leaguers, it’s just too difficult to accept that we will end up pretty mainstream and pick what <em>everybody</em> else picked - finance and/or consulting.</p>
<p>We think somehow there’s a destiny awaiting, a path beckoning, a road less travelled-by, and honor, glory, and fame are within our grasp - and _right now _is the moment to capture it before we are stuck forever in some cubicle in some office building in some major metropolitan area somewhere on this planet. We misperceive the fact that we have made it to the top 1% of the higher-education population (a system based on getting <em>good grades</em>, being <em>well-rounded</em>, and/or <em>excel in one particular area</em>) should be automatically translated into becoming the top 0.1% of the higher-income population (a system based on <em>hard-work</em>, <em>inheritance</em>, <em>networks</em>, <em>economic conditions</em>, and <em>chance</em>). After all, if we have beaten the odds at getting into the best schools, shouldn’t we also beat the odds at making the most amount of money and impact? We assume that life is supposed to get better and better - the same assumption for economic growth, stock indices, and <em>real estate prices</em> in the long-term - and look where that’s gotten us <a href="http://occupywallst.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">today</a>.</p>
<p>Some of us will actually take action to address this dilemma - picking the “Main Street” or being a maverick - most of us will just wait it out and succumb last minute. But even for the brave few I’ve seen, it is usually the same story: They get super excited about a seemingly brilliant idea and invest a lot of time and energy into it; a few months later, when miracle fails to surface (e.g. no venture capital is throwing down millions of dollar for them to play with, or the realization that being a real [read: poor] entrepreneur is too big a step-down from their dream lifestyle of beach-houses and Lamborghini’s), they quickly loses interest and rethink - Epiphany hits and they come to the realization that<em> finance/consulting</em>, and not <em>something else</em>, is the way to go. Because it gives you “a good training.”</p>
<p>But it’s not just the Ivy League, it’s everybody. To quote Seth Davis from the opening scene of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181984/" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Boiler Room</em> (2000)</a>:</p>
<p><em>I read this article a while back that said that Microsoft employs more millionaire secretaries than any other company in the world. They took stock options over Christmas bonuses. It was a good move. I remember there was this photograph of one of the groundskeepers next to his Ferrrari. Blew my mind. You see s<strong>* like that, and it just plants seeds, </strong>makes you think it’s possible, even easy**. And then you turn on the TV, and there’s just more of it. The 87 million dollar lottery winner. That kid actor that just made $20 million on his last movie. That Internet stock that shot through the roof. You could have made millions on it if you’d just got in early. And that’s exactly what I wanted to do: get in. I didn’t want to be an innovator. I just wanted to make the quick and easy buck. I just wanted in.</em></p>
<p><em>Notorious B.I.G. said it best: Either you’re slinging crack rock, or you got a wicked jump shot.’ <strong>Nobody wants to work for it anymore. There’s no honor in taking the after school job at Mickey D’s. Honor’s in the dollar, kid.</strong> So I went the white boy way of slinging crack rock. I became a stock broker.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Fast-forward**</strong> to 2011] <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"></span></strong>“… so I went the Asian kid’s way of becoming a stock broker. I became an investment banker.”**</p>
<p>The movie version of the finance world is a bit exaggerated because it focused on the worst portion of the industry. But the dilemma of being a maverick vs. choosing the main road nonetheless exists.</p>
<p><strong>Part III - Is this a problem and, if so, is there a solution?</strong></p>
<p>Trends are difficult to resist. It’s how they became trends in the first place. You use an iPhone? Own a pair of boat shoes? Ever noticed how many Macs users are on college campuses? We follow trends. Because trends exist to appeal, because most people want to be liked, and because there is usually very little justification for <em>not</em> following trends.</p>
<p>When I spoke at the <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/108857757226101172870/Carnegie?authkey=Gv1sRgCPG439jf9fDLyAE" target="_blank" rel="external">GCC-Carnegie Conference in June</a>, <a href="http://www.cctv.com/english/rcg/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Chenggang Rui</a>, CCTV’s star anchor who goes around interviewing prominent businessmen and politicians, wrapped up his keynote address with a serious concern over the world’s (and China’s) talent pools. “If the guys working for Wall Street are more well-rounded and always had better grades in college than the guys working for the government, then how can the regulators ever outsmart the regulated?” He asked the audience. This talent dynamics is a losing proposition for the government and can only result in more problems in financial regulation down the line.</p>
<p>While Rui’s concern may be an over-simplification of the US political system and Wall Street, his concern is right in that too many people want to work in finance… especially in China.</p>
<p>In China, everybody and his grandma wants to major in finance and work in an investment bank. I’ve seen people with Masters, JD’s, and even PhD’s in fields completely unrelated to finance/economics dishing out resumes to banks and consulting firms.</p>
<p>Sadly, we should probably acknowledge to ourselves that our best educated people will be a generation of financial professionals - at least among the ethnic Chinese.</p>
<p>So we’ve identified the problem, but very few solutions - encouraging students to participate in government, non-profit, education, and business sectors outside of finance/consulting? But what’s the best way to “encourage”? Run a calculation on the expenses associated with college education (especially at the top schools) and you’ll find justification for why everyone wants to make more rather than less. How about teach less about finance and <a href="http://abundance-blog.marelisa-online.com/2009/05/21/harvard-universitys-most-popular-course-positive-psychology/" target="_blank" rel="external">teach more about happiness</a>? Maybe, but it needs to become mainstream to make a real impact (e.g. One day becoming part of the CORE curriculum at Columbia). During my time at Columbia, a new major called “Financial Economics” emerged, and a new minor in “Business Management” is on its way to become one of the most popular selections.<em> Corporate Finance</em> and<em> Accounting and Finance</em> expanded into two sections due to popular demand, and the neighboring Barnard College also began to offer more courses in economics.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.occupyprinceton.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">College students</a> like to blame the banks for spending money to recruit on Ivy League campuses. But the relationships between college caree officers, banks/consulting firms, and the student job-seekers are a matter of freedom of choice. Government and non-profits can either pay the same kind of money to recruit on college campuses, or they can shift people’s opinions to a point where the honor associated with working for government/non-profit is greater than the monetary gains of working anywhere else. Until then, those percentages shown at the top are unlikely to move significantly.</p>
<p>There is a bright side to this: most people stay in finance or consulting for only a few years before moving onto something else. So perhaps there is an alternative solution, not at the undergraduate level, but at the white-collar working level, capturing those career-changers and guide them to making real impact. Perhaps there can be organizations that group ex-bankers and ex-consultants together to create businesses, to consult non-profits, and to sit in workshops to discuss how to find the meaning of life through exploration and self-actualization.</p>
<p>Whatever the solution may be, the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2011/10/occupy-wall-street-spreads-worldwide/100171/" target="_blank" rel="external">problem isn’t going away any time soon</a> - especially <a href="http://brokershandsontheirfacesblog.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">not in this economy</a>.</p>

            <p>So I stayed up almost all night watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168122/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pirates of Silicon Valley</a>. It’s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docudrama" target="_blank" rel="external">docudrama</a> aired in 1999 about the founding of <a href="http://www.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Apple Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Microsoft Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>[caption id=”attachment_321” align=”aligncenter” width=”214” caption=”Featuring Bill Gates the Nerd and Steve Jobs the Egomaniac”]<a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/mv5bmtu1nte3mjawnf5bml5banbnxkftztcwnjeyotkymq-_v1-_sy317_cr240214317_.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/mv5bmtu1nte3mjawnf5bml5banbnxkftztcwnjeyotkymq-_v1-_sy317_cr240214317_.jpg" alt="" title="movie"></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>I must admit, even for a non-computer science major, I knew too little about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_gates" target="_blank" rel="external">Bill Gates</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_jobs" target="_blank" rel="external">Steve Jobs</a>. Probably because the dominant assumption is that they made their wealth back in the 80’s as personal computers took the world, and the computer/software/OS train has gone too far for our generation to catch its tail.<em> That and the fact that I’m stuck at Columbia where the highest career aspirations are becoming bankers and consultants</em>.</p>
<p>But as we are all graduating and trying to figure out where we’re headed, a documented display of how the two walked their paths from nobody to Forbes top 50 sheds light on a few things.</p>
<p>The friendly competition between Gates and Jobs is prevalent in most of our worlds - our classmates, our best friends, our frenemies. <em>Like it or not, we are all competitive</em>. We all like to check out how other people are doing and benchmark ourselves to see where we’re at. But that’s good <em>and</em> bad. Sure, it gets us going and injects a fair dosage of motivation every time we fall behind, but it only motivates us to do what<em>other people are already doing</em>.</p>
<p>And here I thought: That would be a big problem if one wants to be original and create something. Right?</p>
<p>Not so much. At least not according to the film.</p>
<p>Jobs basically copied the user interface and mouse ideas from Xerox to create the Macintosh, and Gates pulled the exact same trick on Jobs and copied the Macintosh to create Windows.</p>
<p>So are these two men great visionaries? Or are they just great copiers? I can’t decide. Was it their ambition to take the world that got them where they are? Or was it their creative ideas?</p>
<p>[caption id=”attachment_316” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”Without these two, you wouldn&#039;t be seeing any of this right now.”]<a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/steve-jobs-vs-bill-gates.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/steve-jobs-vs-bill-gates.jpg" alt="" title="steve-jobs-vs-bill-gates"></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Society wants to extol creativity because in our minds, creativity is a virtue. Theft is not. But ideas aren’t worth a dime if there’s no one to take it to the next level. The tricky part is: Who gets a cut out of the deal. Perhaps that’s where the more recent entrepreneurs, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg" target="_blank" rel="external">Mark Zuckerberg</a>‘s of the world, are encountering many more difficulties, because this generation has learned the lessons of Jobs and Gates, and will not walk until they’ve put up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Winklevoss#cite_note-34" target="_blank" rel="external">serious fight</a>.</p>

            <p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Sentimental Part</span></strong></p>
<p>I took one last look at my comfy bed, wooden floor, coffee table, and picture windows. Two suitcases, one briefcase, ticket in hand booked from Beijing to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>I closed the door.</p>
<p>Eight months ago, I took a leap of faith and decided to take a year off from my life as a student. It was the first time that I was not one since kindergarten. Schools are fun, and having been through 10 different schools growing up, I can confidently say that I was not so afraid of switching out yet again to a new environment.</p>
<p>People gave me all sorts of reactions to my decision. At first, I cared a lot. My parents were vocally against it, and my closest college friends thought I was doing something terribly stupid. But I was not without support. And looking back, I must thank those that inspired me to take this step.</p>
<p>Eight months passed. When I now tell someone that I took a year off, I get lots of questions:</p>
<p>“Why did you take a gap year?”</p>
<p>Because I wanted to.</p>
<p>“What did you do?”</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>“What did you learn?”</p>
<p>A lot more.</p>
<p>I wish there was a simple way to describe it all. With words. But words do a terrible job at capturing emotions and self-actualization efficiently. The most I can do is to list out my projects and achievements in a resume-like fashion as if it was an interview. But that’s not the whole story; it’s just the cover, and maybe the table of content.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the professional experience from Bain, the leadership experiences from GCC, the cultural experience from Beijing, the philanthropic experience from Heart2Heart, or the entrepreneurial experience from a company I founded with my buddy back at Columbia. It was living the unpackaged life, displacing the self from the support system that it has gotten so used to. It was testing assumptions, be wrong, be right, and formulating a view less breakable, a mind less shakable. It was introspection.</p>
<p>How often do you think to yourself, “I’m not like that,” “That’s not who I am,” “That’s not how I do things,” or, “That’s not what I want”? If you think like this pretty often, then congratulations, you seem to know yourself pretty well. For me, these lines didn’t come up often enough throughout my three years of college. True, it was important to keep an open mind, but open-mindedness is hardly self-awareness, and one doesn’t always lead to the next, because too many different experiences at one given time can sometimes confuse you and make you <em>less</em> aware of the self.</p>
<p>Exactly one year ago, I was struggling between the idea of becoming an entrepreneur and taking the traditional corporate path. I had trouble deciding if it’s better to make a thousand acquaintances or maintain a dozen close friends. I couldn’t decide if I should dive into China as early as possible before the window of opportunities closes on me, or spend more time in the US to develop myself before doing so. I sometimes relied on the judgment of others because I didn’t trust myself enough. I had a strong desire to take my path to China and reconnect my roots but I didn’t know how.</p>
<p>I had a <strong>lot</strong> to reconcile.</p>
<p>In the past eight months, I have done each of these conflicts some justice. I’ve found some valuable insights to these questions - some answered in full, some waiting to be solved.</p>
<p>Eight months later, I look into the mirror, and I see someone that I know better. After all, it’s me that I have to deal with for my entire life, and getting to know myself better is probably more useful than knowing anyone else.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">My Advice</span></strong></p>
<p>I made a few summaries below based on my above-mentioned experiences in China. Hopefully, if you ever decide to take a gap year, you too can discover its magical effects.</p>
<p><strong>Beijing/China</strong> - The real life doesn’t give out award certificates. No one is obligated to be your friend and to spend his or her precious time with you “hanging out.” Real life is filled with individuals who are pragmatic, materialistic, and pretentious; and most people have got an agenda of some sort behind his or her actions. Useless relationships die after one meal; useful relationships rekindle even after months-long gaps. This is true whether you’re talking to entry-level employees or attending a high-profile networking cocktail watching corporate executives do their dances. (Students, fortunately, may be the only exception here.)</p>
<p>Beijing is a tough place to be. It focuses the many desires of China into a tip so sharp that you can sense it in the directness of how people approach you for things. Local Chinese don’t get paid very well, so in order to make it some day they must do what it takes - sometimes things that would be considered unethical in the West. Office politics are layered in matrices of personal relationships. Sentences can be delivered in ten ways but interpreted in twenty. Thinking too much is better than thinking not enough. And _never _trust someone that you can’t verify through another friend.</p>
<p><strong>Age/淡定</strong> - As students we honestly don’t think much about age. We are in a system called “school” which places us in the right places at the right age. But in the real world these restrictions are looser. How old are you? How old do people think you are? How old would you like to be? How old would you need to be? But really, how old <strong>can</strong> you be? Sometimes you are at the right place at the right time, but you might be at the wrong age. In the West, youth is good. Youth is energy, opportunities, and possibilities. But in China, youth is immaturity. It equates to inexperience, which to most people screams unreliability (i.e. 不靠谱).</p>
<p>We often think of discrimination in terms of gender, race, and other common distinctions. But age is just as key, and twice as severe in a country that has a hierarchical system by age. What I’m trying to say is this: Don’t let age limit you, but also don’t misperceive your own mental age. At what age does one find oneself exactly? Maybe one never does. But with age, you acquire a sense of 淡定. The nirvana stage of life. The moment when you have gained full control of the self.</p>
<p><strong>Management Consulting</strong> - Mergers&amp;Inquisitions posted <a href="http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/china-private-equity/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=china-private-equity" target="_blank" rel="external">an excellent article about PE in China</a> a few weeks ago. I would borrow the general idea from there and say that the difference between working for MBB in developed markets vs. their emerging market offices is just <strong>huge</strong>. I was talking to a friend who is working at the McKinsey New York office and was told that he never had trouble finding market segment data about the industries that he was covering. They just email the research department and open Outlook the next morning - and <em>voila</em>!</p>
<p>Well, the bad news is, data mining is virtually the bulk of your work in China as an intern in consulting. Industry data don’t really exist because there is not a developed set of research companies that gather these data and make profits off them - asking Chinese companies to pay for data is like asking Chinese college students to pay for .mp3 music. So instead of buying it from someone, you hire cheap labour (i.e. The PTAs) and have them find the data for you via all possible methods. (I’ll leave the methods to your imagination. And you can think of the reliability of the data given those methods.)</p>
<p><strong>Purpose/Meaning of Life</strong> - I would be megalomaniac if I think that I can somehow explain the meaning of life. But the general idea here is to find it. Something. Anything. The problem with most college grads is that once one has reached the college level (or grad school for that matter - once one has finished one’s education), one is lost. One gets a job. One meets a boy/girl. One marries, has kids, and realizes it’s too late to change careers because the opportunity costs are too high.</p>
<p>So we all know how serious it is to take the right step right now. Without going any deeper and making this whole post about the meaning of life altogether, I want to say that whatever you do, do it for a virtuous purpose. <em>Virtuous</em> is the keyword here. Money, fame, bottles-and-models, are <strong>not</strong> virtuous purposes. Honor (not fame), pride (not ego), and the well-beings of others (family, friends, even strangers) are.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The Resume Version</strong></span></p>
<p>Below, I decided to list out the milestones of this past eight months, with pictures and videos, to demonstrate that, <strong>no</strong>, I did not just waste time in China to 混. I did many things that I would’ve never been able to do without spending those eight months in Beijing. (The external photos are all linked to Picasa, so feel free to <a href="mailto:dyz2102@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="external">contact me</a> if you cannot get access.)</p>

<p>So I’m off the plane, checked in a hotel, and ready to start the 10 weeks on my dream internship. I launched my gap year leaving this place exactly ten months ago. Same office, same hotel, same taxis, same routes, same elevators, and many of the same people.</p>
<p>But this time, it’s a different me.</p>

            <p>Update:</p>
<p>Wenyi Zhou, my fellow colleague from GCC who is going to attend Columbia this fall, pointed out a few points that I missed in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One other show that made an impact in terms of New York’s popular culture is “How I Met Your Mother”;</p>
</li>
<li><p>2010 is the year when CU started to use Common Application, and rose to #4 on US News Best National University Ranking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wenyi made some good points - my bad. I guess Columbia did get better by US News World Report standard. And switching over to the common application definitely gets you more applicants - only marginal effort to apply to one more college, why not?</p>
<p>Original Post:</p>
<p>So I started reading on 各种 Facebook status today that “Columbia College admissions rate drops to 6.4%…” It’s all over the internet as well:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2011/03/30/cc-admit-rate-drops-64-percent" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2011/03/30/cc-admit-rate-drops-64-percent</a></p>
<p><a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/03/31/sorry-seniors-college-admission-rates-are-down-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/03/31/sorry-seniors-college-admission-rates-are-down-this-year/</a></p>
<p>To us Columbians, this small, insignificant number represents pride, honor, and _bragging rights _more than anything else. We keep an eye on it like macro traders keep an eye on the Fed funds rate.</p>
<p>So Columbia beats everyone except Harvard for “competitiveness” - 6.4% vs. 6.2% of Harvard College. What happened to Yale, Princeton, Stanford?</p>
<p>To me, these record low numbers represent two things:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Implication Number One:</span> The world is getting more competitive every day.</strong></p>
<p>The truth is usually ugly. My grandparents stayed with me a few weeks back and went on and on about how I don’t sleep enough, how I can’t treat my body like this, how I need to take my health seriously, etc. etc. But really, I’m not the only one who’s hard at work here - everyone else is as well.</p>
<p>In less than two decades, there will be more Chinese speaking English than the whole population of the United States. People are learning and advancing, and there is nothing to stop that the world from progressing exponentially. The truth is, we are working 10x+ more efficiently than our parents, and maybe producing 100x more content, intellectual property, innovation, ideas, designs, and other forms of “work” than our parents did when they were in their 20’s because we work longer hours (counting my blogging time now as “working” for instance).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Implication Number Two:</span> Gossip Girl and Sex and the City are making an impact on college decisions.</strong></p>
<p>Students don’t just want a good education no more. They want a good lifestyle too. Living in Philly just won’t cut it. Princeton is for old people. New Haven? Forget it. Maybe West Coast, but that costs a lot. And you need to get a car.</p>
<p>It’s the Empire State. New York may longer be the engine of economic growth, but it has become the symbol of luxury, sex, diversity, wealth, freedom, liberty, and just pure awesomeness.</p>
<p>Wanna get away from home? New York. Wanna find a job? New York. Wanna have a good time? New York. Wanna sound baller when people ask you “where are you from” and say “New York”? … New York. So naturally, “Columbia University in the City of New York” appears to be a sound value proposition when a college senior from Tennessee glances through the brochures of the top US schools. Ever wonder why Columbia calls itself a name that long? Now you do.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, summing up one and two, what New York has that no other city in the US can offer is simply <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>opportunities</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Students are engaging with the outside world at an earlier age than they ever before. Take Global China Connection for example - I’ve seen 3-4 people taking a gap year in the middle of our academic studies to spend in China. Students are getting internships between classes to get a head start on their careers. They are attending events to network with professionals to get themselves a foot in the door for a future internship or job. In a difficult job market that’s getting more competitive, this can be your winning strategy. And there is no better place to do a part-time internship or attend a big event than Manhattan.</p>
