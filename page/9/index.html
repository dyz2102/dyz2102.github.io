            <p><strong>The Scare</strong></p>
<p>I was in Philadelphia two weekends ago, when Occupy Wall Street  had just popped up on my laptop screen for a few days. I was attending an info session for GCC-UPenn and was about to head back to New York. I was in a suit and carried a briefcase.</p>
<p>I was buying a bottle of green tea at the bus stop stand when the guy, after ignoring me for a full 30 seconds chatting with his friends, offered me $18 for the bottle. I startled. He laughed and said it was only $2. He then checked me up and down and asked his friends, “How much do you think this guy makes? $300k a year?” He turned toward me. “Ain’t that right? $300,000?” I paused. At this point I think my sympathetic nervous system was fully at work.</p>
<p>In the interest of self-protection, I said, “No I’m still a student looking for a job, that’s why I’m dressed like this.” Not far from the truth. At least not as far as the difference between 300k and however much I might be making if I were actually working right now. Did I look <em>that</em> old? Or did he just have no idea how much men-in-suits typically  make?</p>
<p>Blame me for being overly sensitive but, I’ve wore a suit in the US since 10th grade MUN conferences, and this was the first time that I felt a bit threatened because of it.</p>
<p><strong>The Interview Room</strong></p>
<p>A few days later, a friend of mine went into an interview and was asked a question about Occupy Wall Street.</p>
<p>“So what do you think of the protest?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s a big waste of time. These people should spend their time and energy finding a job instead,” the interviewee said.</p>
<p>Lucky for him, the interviewer actually<strong> felt the same way</strong>. But such response is far too risky at a sensitive time like this. What if you met someone who liked everything in politically correct terms?</p>
<p>And if <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2011/10/occupy-wall-street-spreads-worldwide/100171/" target="_blank" rel="external">this article</a> from last week’s <em>the Atlantic</em> didn’t convince you to never mention “money” as one of your motivations during interview, I don’t know what will.</p>
<p><strong>What This Mean to You</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not Occupy Wall Street ever took place, people in finance are going to be making less in the foreseeable future. <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/312639" target="_blank" rel="external">Banks are already downsizing their risks as well as number of employees</a>. To borrow from <a href="mergersandinquisitions.com">Mergers &amp; Inquisitions</a>‘s <a href="http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/wall-street-hate/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=wall-street-hate" target="_blank" rel="external">recent blog on Occupy Wall Street</a>, “nowadays people go into Wall Street _expecting _to get rich, whereas in the 1980s they went to Wall Street <em>hoping</em> to get rich.” So if anything, the recent protest should really make those who are still “thinking” about going into finance to really dig deep and examine the core motivations behind their career choices.</p>
<p>And when all else fail to answer your inquiries - <a href="http://davidyzhu.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/252/" target="_blank" rel="external">take a gap year</a>.</p>

            <p>So the recent <a href="http://occupywallst.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Occupy Wall Street</a> movement got me curious to look into what percentage of people at Columbia go into finance. I flipped through the CCE (Columbia’s <a href="http://www.careereducation.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="external">Center for Career Education</a>) website to see if they’ve got this sheet of statistic on where Columbia students end up working after graduation. It turns out they still have it. And the numbers have escaped me since I last saw them back in 2007 during my CCE orientation as a freshman…</p>
<p><strong>Part I - The Stats</strong></p>

<p>An astonishing 24.9% of the Class of 2010 in CC and SEAS ended up working in financial services, with an additional 9.1% in consulting. SEAS graduate programs yield a whopping 32.9% for finance and 9.2% for consulting. (For a school as specialized as “engineering,” this could almost warrant a change in the school’s name.)</p>

<p>Now I got really curious and, before we begin to judge Columbia, let’s take a look at <a href="http://www.ocs.fas.harvard.edu/students/jobs/seniorsurvey.htm" target="_blank" rel="external">Harvard</a>.</p>
<p>[caption id=”attachment_324” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”Source: Seniors Survey, Office of Career Services, Harvard University”]<a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/screen-shot-2011-10-13-at-4-03-21-am.png" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/screen-shot-2011-10-13-at-4-03-21-am.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2011-10-13 at 4.03.21 AM"></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>On the Charles River, over the past five years, we see a few trends: smaller percentage of students in finance/consulting, fewer in military, more in non-profit, health/medicine, communications/media/arts, and business (presumably this is where entrepreneurship would fall).</p>
<p>Since we don’t have trend data by industry for Columbia, it’s hard to make trend comparisons. But just taking the 2010 data alone, 33% of Harvard seniors planned to work in finance or consulting - almost at the same level as Columbia’s 34% (though showing a noticeable difference where consulting firms historically have a stronger preference for Harvard than Columbia). At its height, <strong>47% of Harvard seniors planned to work in finance or consulting in 2008</strong> <strong>(just before the financial crisis)</strong>. I’d assume Columbia’s 2008 numbers were probably similar.</p>

<p>So I’ve been asked this many times and have wondered this myself - <em><strong>why do so many students from top universities end up in finance or consulting</strong></em>?</p>
<p>Here’s my take on why.</p>
<p><strong>Part II - The Qualitative Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Let’s admit it - for most of us, we have <em>no</em> idea of what we want to do after college. For starters, we all know that this campus is skewed toward finance and consulting (because that’s all that we hear about) - but for the average-over-achieving-Ivy-Leaguers, it’s just too difficult to accept that we will end up pretty mainstream and pick what <em>everybody</em> else picked - finance and/or consulting.</p>
<p>We think somehow there’s a destiny awaiting, a path beckoning, a road less travelled-by, and honor, glory, and fame are within our grasp - and _right now _is the moment to capture it before we are stuck forever in some cubicle in some office building in some major metropolitan area somewhere on this planet. We misperceive the fact that we have made it to the top 1% of the higher-education population (a system based on getting <em>good grades</em>, being <em>well-rounded</em>, and/or <em>excel in one particular area</em>) should be automatically translated into becoming the top 0.1% of the higher-income population (a system based on <em>hard-work</em>, <em>inheritance</em>, <em>networks</em>, <em>economic conditions</em>, and <em>chance</em>). After all, if we have beaten the odds at getting into the best schools, shouldn’t we also beat the odds at making the most amount of money and impact? We assume that life is supposed to get better and better - the same assumption for economic growth, stock indices, and <em>real estate prices</em> in the long-term - and look where that’s gotten us <a href="http://occupywallst.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">today</a>.</p>
<p>Some of us will actually take action to address this dilemma - picking the “Main Street” or being a maverick - most of us will just wait it out and succumb last minute. But even for the brave few I’ve seen, it is usually the same story: They get super excited about a seemingly brilliant idea and invest a lot of time and energy into it; a few months later, when miracle fails to surface (e.g. no venture capital is throwing down millions of dollar for them to play with, or the realization that being a real [read: poor] entrepreneur is too big a step-down from their dream lifestyle of beach-houses and Lamborghini’s), they quickly loses interest and rethink - Epiphany hits and they come to the realization that<em> finance/consulting</em>, and not <em>something else</em>, is the way to go. Because it gives you “a good training.”</p>
<p>But it’s not just the Ivy League, it’s everybody. To quote Seth Davis from the opening scene of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181984/" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Boiler Room</em> (2000)</a>:</p>
<p><em>I read this article a while back that said that Microsoft employs more millionaire secretaries than any other company in the world. They took stock options over Christmas bonuses. It was a good move. I remember there was this photograph of one of the groundskeepers next to his Ferrrari. Blew my mind. You see s<strong>* like that, and it just plants seeds, </strong>makes you think it’s possible, even easy**. And then you turn on the TV, and there’s just more of it. The 87 million dollar lottery winner. That kid actor that just made $20 million on his last movie. That Internet stock that shot through the roof. You could have made millions on it if you’d just got in early. And that’s exactly what I wanted to do: get in. I didn’t want to be an innovator. I just wanted to make the quick and easy buck. I just wanted in.</em></p>
<p><em>Notorious B.I.G. said it best: Either you’re slinging crack rock, or you got a wicked jump shot.’ <strong>Nobody wants to work for it anymore. There’s no honor in taking the after school job at Mickey D’s. Honor’s in the dollar, kid.</strong> So I went the white boy way of slinging crack rock. I became a stock broker.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Fast-forward**</strong> to 2011] <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"></span></strong>“… so I went the Asian kid’s way of becoming a stock broker. I became an investment banker.”**</p>
<p>The movie version of the finance world is a bit exaggerated because it focused on the worst portion of the industry. But the dilemma of being a maverick vs. choosing the main road nonetheless exists.</p>
<p><strong>Part III - Is this a problem and, if so, is there a solution?</strong></p>
<p>Trends are difficult to resist. It’s how they became trends in the first place. You use an iPhone? Own a pair of boat shoes? Ever noticed how many Macs users are on college campuses? We follow trends. Because trends exist to appeal, because most people want to be liked, and because there is usually very little justification for <em>not</em> following trends.</p>
<p>When I spoke at the <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/108857757226101172870/Carnegie?authkey=Gv1sRgCPG439jf9fDLyAE" target="_blank" rel="external">GCC-Carnegie Conference in June</a>, <a href="http://www.cctv.com/english/rcg/index.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Chenggang Rui</a>, CCTV’s star anchor who goes around interviewing prominent businessmen and politicians, wrapped up his keynote address with a serious concern over the world’s (and China’s) talent pools. “If the guys working for Wall Street are more well-rounded and always had better grades in college than the guys working for the government, then how can the regulators ever outsmart the regulated?” He asked the audience. This talent dynamics is a losing proposition for the government and can only result in more problems in financial regulation down the line.</p>
<p>While Rui’s concern may be an over-simplification of the US political system and Wall Street, his concern is right in that too many people want to work in finance… especially in China.</p>
<p>In China, everybody and his grandma wants to major in finance and work in an investment bank. I’ve seen people with Masters, JD’s, and even PhD’s in fields completely unrelated to finance/economics dishing out resumes to banks and consulting firms.</p>
<p>Sadly, we should probably acknowledge to ourselves that our best educated people will be a generation of financial professionals - at least among the ethnic Chinese.</p>
<p>So we’ve identified the problem, but very few solutions - encouraging students to participate in government, non-profit, education, and business sectors outside of finance/consulting? But what’s the best way to “encourage”? Run a calculation on the expenses associated with college education (especially at the top schools) and you’ll find justification for why everyone wants to make more rather than less. How about teach less about finance and <a href="http://abundance-blog.marelisa-online.com/2009/05/21/harvard-universitys-most-popular-course-positive-psychology/" target="_blank" rel="external">teach more about happiness</a>? Maybe, but it needs to become mainstream to make a real impact (e.g. One day becoming part of the CORE curriculum at Columbia). During my time at Columbia, a new major called “Financial Economics” emerged, and a new minor in “Business Management” is on its way to become one of the most popular selections.<em> Corporate Finance</em> and<em> Accounting and Finance</em> expanded into two sections due to popular demand, and the neighboring Barnard College also began to offer more courses in economics.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.occupyprinceton.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">College students</a> like to blame the banks for spending money to recruit on Ivy League campuses. But the relationships between college caree officers, banks/consulting firms, and the student job-seekers are a matter of freedom of choice. Government and non-profits can either pay the same kind of money to recruit on college campuses, or they can shift people’s opinions to a point where the honor associated with working for government/non-profit is greater than the monetary gains of working anywhere else. Until then, those percentages shown at the top are unlikely to move significantly.</p>
<p>There is a bright side to this: most people stay in finance or consulting for only a few years before moving onto something else. So perhaps there is an alternative solution, not at the undergraduate level, but at the white-collar working level, capturing those career-changers and guide them to making real impact. Perhaps there can be organizations that group ex-bankers and ex-consultants together to create businesses, to consult non-profits, and to sit in workshops to discuss how to find the meaning of life through exploration and self-actualization.</p>
<p>Whatever the solution may be, the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2011/10/occupy-wall-street-spreads-worldwide/100171/" target="_blank" rel="external">problem isn’t going away any time soon</a> - especially <a href="http://brokershandsontheirfacesblog.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">not in this economy</a>.</p>

            <p>So I stayed up almost all night watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168122/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pirates of Silicon Valley</a>. It’s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docudrama" target="_blank" rel="external">docudrama</a> aired in 1999 about the founding of <a href="http://www.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Apple Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Microsoft Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>[caption id=”attachment_321” align=”aligncenter” width=”214” caption=”Featuring Bill Gates the Nerd and Steve Jobs the Egomaniac”]<a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/mv5bmtu1nte3mjawnf5bml5banbnxkftztcwnjeyotkymq-_v1-_sy317_cr240214317_.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/mv5bmtu1nte3mjawnf5bml5banbnxkftztcwnjeyotkymq-_v1-_sy317_cr240214317_.jpg" alt="" title="movie"></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>I must admit, even for a non-computer science major, I knew too little about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_gates" target="_blank" rel="external">Bill Gates</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_jobs" target="_blank" rel="external">Steve Jobs</a>. Probably because the dominant assumption is that they made their wealth back in the 80’s as personal computers took the world, and the computer/software/OS train has gone too far for our generation to catch its tail.<em> That and the fact that I’m stuck at Columbia where the highest career aspirations are becoming bankers and consultants</em>.</p>
<p>But as we are all graduating and trying to figure out where we’re headed, a documented display of how the two walked their paths from nobody to Forbes top 50 sheds light on a few things.</p>
<p>The friendly competition between Gates and Jobs is prevalent in most of our worlds - our classmates, our best friends, our frenemies. <em>Like it or not, we are all competitive</em>. We all like to check out how other people are doing and benchmark ourselves to see where we’re at. But that’s good <em>and</em> bad. Sure, it gets us going and injects a fair dosage of motivation every time we fall behind, but it only motivates us to do what<em>other people are already doing</em>.</p>
<p>And here I thought: That would be a big problem if one wants to be original and create something. Right?</p>
<p>Not so much. At least not according to the film.</p>
<p>Jobs basically copied the user interface and mouse ideas from Xerox to create the Macintosh, and Gates pulled the exact same trick on Jobs and copied the Macintosh to create Windows.</p>
<p>So are these two men great visionaries? Or are they just great copiers? I can’t decide. Was it their ambition to take the world that got them where they are? Or was it their creative ideas?</p>
<p>[caption id=”attachment_316” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”Without these two, you wouldn&#039;t be seeing any of this right now.”]<a href="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/steve-jobs-vs-bill-gates.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="http://davidyzhu.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/steve-jobs-vs-bill-gates.jpg" alt="" title="steve-jobs-vs-bill-gates"></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Society wants to extol creativity because in our minds, creativity is a virtue. Theft is not. But ideas aren’t worth a dime if there’s no one to take it to the next level. The tricky part is: Who gets a cut out of the deal. Perhaps that’s where the more recent entrepreneurs, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg" target="_blank" rel="external">Mark Zuckerberg</a>‘s of the world, are encountering many more difficulties, because this generation has learned the lessons of Jobs and Gates, and will not walk until they’ve put up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Winklevoss#cite_note-34" target="_blank" rel="external">serious fight</a>.</p>

            <p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Sentimental Part</span></strong></p>
<p>I took one last look at my comfy bed, wooden floor, coffee table, and picture windows. Two suitcases, one briefcase, ticket in hand booked from Beijing to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>I closed the door.</p>
<p>Eight months ago, I took a leap of faith and decided to take a year off from my life as a student. It was the first time that I was not one since kindergarten. Schools are fun, and having been through 10 different schools growing up, I can confidently say that I was not so afraid of switching out yet again to a new environment.</p>
<p>People gave me all sorts of reactions to my decision. At first, I cared a lot. My parents were vocally against it, and my closest college friends thought I was doing something terribly stupid. But I was not without support. And looking back, I must thank those that inspired me to take this step.</p>
<p>Eight months passed. When I now tell someone that I took a year off, I get lots of questions:</p>
<p>“Why did you take a gap year?”</p>
<p>Because I wanted to.</p>
<p>“What did you do?”</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>“What did you learn?”</p>
<p>A lot more.</p>
<p>I wish there was a simple way to describe it all. With words. But words do a terrible job at capturing emotions and self-actualization efficiently. The most I can do is to list out my projects and achievements in a resume-like fashion as if it was an interview. But that’s not the whole story; it’s just the cover, and maybe the table of content.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the professional experience from Bain, the leadership experiences from GCC, the cultural experience from Beijing, the philanthropic experience from Heart2Heart, or the entrepreneurial experience from a company I founded with my buddy back at Columbia. It was living the unpackaged life, displacing the self from the support system that it has gotten so used to. It was testing assumptions, be wrong, be right, and formulating a view less breakable, a mind less shakable. It was introspection.</p>
<p>How often do you think to yourself, “I’m not like that,” “That’s not who I am,” “That’s not how I do things,” or, “That’s not what I want”? If you think like this pretty often, then congratulations, you seem to know yourself pretty well. For me, these lines didn’t come up often enough throughout my three years of college. True, it was important to keep an open mind, but open-mindedness is hardly self-awareness, and one doesn’t always lead to the next, because too many different experiences at one given time can sometimes confuse you and make you <em>less</em> aware of the self.</p>
<p>Exactly one year ago, I was struggling between the idea of becoming an entrepreneur and taking the traditional corporate path. I had trouble deciding if it’s better to make a thousand acquaintances or maintain a dozen close friends. I couldn’t decide if I should dive into China as early as possible before the window of opportunities closes on me, or spend more time in the US to develop myself before doing so. I sometimes relied on the judgment of others because I didn’t trust myself enough. I had a strong desire to take my path to China and reconnect my roots but I didn’t know how.</p>
<p>I had a <strong>lot</strong> to reconcile.</p>
<p>In the past eight months, I have done each of these conflicts some justice. I’ve found some valuable insights to these questions - some answered in full, some waiting to be solved.</p>
<p>Eight months later, I look into the mirror, and I see someone that I know better. After all, it’s me that I have to deal with for my entire life, and getting to know myself better is probably more useful than knowing anyone else.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">My Advice</span></strong></p>
<p>I made a few summaries below based on my above-mentioned experiences in China. Hopefully, if you ever decide to take a gap year, you too can discover its magical effects.</p>
<p><strong>Beijing/China</strong> - The real life doesn’t give out award certificates. No one is obligated to be your friend and to spend his or her precious time with you “hanging out.” Real life is filled with individuals who are pragmatic, materialistic, and pretentious; and most people have got an agenda of some sort behind his or her actions. Useless relationships die after one meal; useful relationships rekindle even after months-long gaps. This is true whether you’re talking to entry-level employees or attending a high-profile networking cocktail watching corporate executives do their dances. (Students, fortunately, may be the only exception here.)</p>
<p>Beijing is a tough place to be. It focuses the many desires of China into a tip so sharp that you can sense it in the directness of how people approach you for things. Local Chinese don’t get paid very well, so in order to make it some day they must do what it takes - sometimes things that would be considered unethical in the West. Office politics are layered in matrices of personal relationships. Sentences can be delivered in ten ways but interpreted in twenty. Thinking too much is better than thinking not enough. And _never _trust someone that you can’t verify through another friend.</p>
<p><strong>Age/淡定</strong> - As students we honestly don’t think much about age. We are in a system called “school” which places us in the right places at the right age. But in the real world these restrictions are looser. How old are you? How old do people think you are? How old would you like to be? How old would you need to be? But really, how old <strong>can</strong> you be? Sometimes you are at the right place at the right time, but you might be at the wrong age. In the West, youth is good. Youth is energy, opportunities, and possibilities. But in China, youth is immaturity. It equates to inexperience, which to most people screams unreliability (i.e. 不靠谱).</p>
<p>We often think of discrimination in terms of gender, race, and other common distinctions. But age is just as key, and twice as severe in a country that has a hierarchical system by age. What I’m trying to say is this: Don’t let age limit you, but also don’t misperceive your own mental age. At what age does one find oneself exactly? Maybe one never does. But with age, you acquire a sense of 淡定. The nirvana stage of life. The moment when you have gained full control of the self.</p>
<p><strong>Management Consulting</strong> - Mergers&amp;Inquisitions posted <a href="http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/china-private-equity/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=china-private-equity" target="_blank" rel="external">an excellent article about PE in China</a> a few weeks ago. I would borrow the general idea from there and say that the difference between working for MBB in developed markets vs. their emerging market offices is just <strong>huge</strong>. I was talking to a friend who is working at the McKinsey New York office and was told that he never had trouble finding market segment data about the industries that he was covering. They just email the research department and open Outlook the next morning - and <em>voila</em>!</p>
<p>Well, the bad news is, data mining is virtually the bulk of your work in China as an intern in consulting. Industry data don’t really exist because there is not a developed set of research companies that gather these data and make profits off them - asking Chinese companies to pay for data is like asking Chinese college students to pay for .mp3 music. So instead of buying it from someone, you hire cheap labour (i.e. The PTAs) and have them find the data for you via all possible methods. (I’ll leave the methods to your imagination. And you can think of the reliability of the data given those methods.)</p>
<p><strong>Purpose/Meaning of Life</strong> - I would be megalomaniac if I think that I can somehow explain the meaning of life. But the general idea here is to find it. Something. Anything. The problem with most college grads is that once one has reached the college level (or grad school for that matter - once one has finished one’s education), one is lost. One gets a job. One meets a boy/girl. One marries, has kids, and realizes it’s too late to change careers because the opportunity costs are too high.</p>
<p>So we all know how serious it is to take the right step right now. Without going any deeper and making this whole post about the meaning of life altogether, I want to say that whatever you do, do it for a virtuous purpose. <em>Virtuous</em> is the keyword here. Money, fame, bottles-and-models, are <strong>not</strong> virtuous purposes. Honor (not fame), pride (not ego), and the well-beings of others (family, friends, even strangers) are.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The Resume Version</strong></span></p>
<p>Below, I decided to list out the milestones of this past eight months, with pictures and videos, to demonstrate that, <strong>no</strong>, I did not just waste time in China to 混. I did many things that I would’ve never been able to do without spending those eight months in Beijing. (The external photos are all linked to Picasa, so feel free to <a href="mailto:dyz2102@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="external">contact me</a> if you cannot get access.)</p>

<p>So I’m off the plane, checked in a hotel, and ready to start the 10 weeks on my dream internship. I launched my gap year leaving this place exactly ten months ago. Same office, same hotel, same taxis, same routes, same elevators, and many of the same people.</p>
<p>But this time, it’s a different me.</p>

            <p>Update:</p>
<p>Wenyi Zhou, my fellow colleague from GCC who is going to attend Columbia this fall, pointed out a few points that I missed in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One other show that made an impact in terms of New York’s popular culture is “How I Met Your Mother”;</p>
</li>
<li><p>2010 is the year when CU started to use Common Application, and rose to #4 on US News Best National University Ranking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wenyi made some good points - my bad. I guess Columbia did get better by US News World Report standard. And switching over to the common application definitely gets you more applicants - only marginal effort to apply to one more college, why not?</p>
<p>Original Post:</p>
<p>So I started reading on 各种 Facebook status today that “Columbia College admissions rate drops to 6.4%…” It’s all over the internet as well:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2011/03/30/cc-admit-rate-drops-64-percent" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2011/03/30/cc-admit-rate-drops-64-percent</a></p>
<p><a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/03/31/sorry-seniors-college-admission-rates-are-down-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/03/31/sorry-seniors-college-admission-rates-are-down-this-year/</a></p>
<p>To us Columbians, this small, insignificant number represents pride, honor, and _bragging rights _more than anything else. We keep an eye on it like macro traders keep an eye on the Fed funds rate.</p>
<p>So Columbia beats everyone except Harvard for “competitiveness” - 6.4% vs. 6.2% of Harvard College. What happened to Yale, Princeton, Stanford?</p>
<p>To me, these record low numbers represent two things:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Implication Number One:</span> The world is getting more competitive every day.</strong></p>
<p>The truth is usually ugly. My grandparents stayed with me a few weeks back and went on and on about how I don’t sleep enough, how I can’t treat my body like this, how I need to take my health seriously, etc. etc. But really, I’m not the only one who’s hard at work here - everyone else is as well.</p>
<p>In less than two decades, there will be more Chinese speaking English than the whole population of the United States. People are learning and advancing, and there is nothing to stop that the world from progressing exponentially. The truth is, we are working 10x+ more efficiently than our parents, and maybe producing 100x more content, intellectual property, innovation, ideas, designs, and other forms of “work” than our parents did when they were in their 20’s because we work longer hours (counting my blogging time now as “working” for instance).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Implication Number Two:</span> Gossip Girl and Sex and the City are making an impact on college decisions.</strong></p>
<p>Students don’t just want a good education no more. They want a good lifestyle too. Living in Philly just won’t cut it. Princeton is for old people. New Haven? Forget it. Maybe West Coast, but that costs a lot. And you need to get a car.</p>
<p>It’s the Empire State. New York may longer be the engine of economic growth, but it has become the symbol of luxury, sex, diversity, wealth, freedom, liberty, and just pure awesomeness.</p>
<p>Wanna get away from home? New York. Wanna find a job? New York. Wanna have a good time? New York. Wanna sound baller when people ask you “where are you from” and say “New York”? … New York. So naturally, “Columbia University in the City of New York” appears to be a sound value proposition when a college senior from Tennessee glances through the brochures of the top US schools. Ever wonder why Columbia calls itself a name that long? Now you do.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, summing up one and two, what New York has that no other city in the US can offer is simply <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>opportunities</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Students are engaging with the outside world at an earlier age than they ever before. Take Global China Connection for example - I’ve seen 3-4 people taking a gap year in the middle of our academic studies to spend in China. Students are getting internships between classes to get a head start on their careers. They are attending events to network with professionals to get themselves a foot in the door for a future internship or job. In a difficult job market that’s getting more competitive, this can be your winning strategy. And there is no better place to do a part-time internship or attend a big event than Manhattan.</p>

            <p>After not seeing New York for a year, this trip has turned out to be slightly more overwhelming than I had mentally prepared myself for lol.</p>
<p>So my 13hr flight from Beijing to Newark was delayed (again… 点子太低了) because - get this - they apparently didn’t communicate that the US is now on daylight savings. Beijing air traffic authorities are either challenged or full of BS.</p>
<p>Anyhow, got to Columbia, everything’s closed. Lots to say about the comparison now between Beijing vs. New York. But I guess that’ll have to wait. For now, it’s dinner with GCC followed by night at Circle with good old 2011’ers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello Columbia - it’s good to be back. Even for a week ;)</p>

            <p>Below is a comment from Forbes.com that a friend of mine posted on Renren. As someone who is struggling to decide where his life should head post-college, and when to wrap up his US education and begin his China career, I felt that this article really touched on something that all of us college grads (or soon-to-be college grads anyway) have probably thought about. I’ve written a few thoughts below as well:</p>

<p>In February, three Wharton faculty colleagues and I had the pleasure of dining with 19 visiting students from one of China’s most prestigious universities. The students were young. They were charming. They were very intelligent. And they were very, very goal-directed.</p>
<p>My colleagues and I had each prepared brief opening remarks, but the students were having none of it. They had elected a delegation leader, and the delegation leader, as quickly as possible, got to the question the students all wanted to address: What are the implications of the current financial and economic crisis?</p>
<p>A colleague in the accounting department gave them a careful, scholarly, even-handed explanation of how firms’ decisions on the repricing of assets in their portfolio could perhaps have been used, perhaps unintentionally, to create false expectations in the marketplace, and could have been done in a way undetectable to auditors, leading to over-investment in toxic subprime assets.</p>
<p>No, that’s not what the students wanted to discuss. With much less tact, I explained that, indeed, mispricing of assets at an inflated price could have been deliberately used to create the illusion of value, and this could then have been used to create the very real rewards of wealth for the financial engineering wizards responsible for the scheme.</p>
<p>This got us much closer to the questions that the visiting students wanted to address. Their first round of questions were basically, How can I get that job? How can I get a high-paying job in investment banking now?</p>
<p>My colleagues and I attempted to convince them that those jobs simply will not exist again, at historical levels of compensation, in the months or years before these students’ graduation.</p>
<p>This led to a second round of questions, like, What can I do while working as a desk drone in an audit firm in China to ensure that I can get into Wharton, Harvard or Stanford, and get a job in investment banking later? The students were patient. They did not need a job with a $10 million bonus now, as long as the prospect of receiving it later would still arise.</p>
<p>I then suggested that perhaps they might work for companies that made things. Actual things. With a burgeoning middle class that would soon be larger than the entire population of the U.S. or Western Europe, surely there was going to be a huge domestic market for things in China. The students could pursue careers with companies that were working to develop and to sell appliances fit for a Chinese home, or mass-market, branded consumer package goods for the new middle class Chinese consumer.</p>
<p>This was met with stares from the students. Another colleague from the management department suggested that Chinese retailing and distribution offered two other growth opportunities for a bold young entrepreneur. Again, we got mostly stares.</p>
<p>I then explained that there are really only three ways for an individual to earn tens of millions of dollars a year:</p>
<p>–Create a company that creates real wealth and keep a piece of the company. Bill Gates did that at Microsoft (nasdaq: MSFT - news - people ), and he is, probably, still one of the five wealthiest men in America. Vanderbilt (railroads and shipping), Carnegie (U.S. Steel (nyse: X - news - people )) and Rockefeller (Standard Oil) did it, too. These men played hardball, seeking to crush commercial competitors, but they did successfully transform America and the world.</p>
<p>–Facilitate the creation of real wealth by others and keep a piece of each transaction. J. P. Morgan convinced European investors that they would earn far more investing in the fastest-growing industries in the United States than they would investing in their more developed, more mature and more slowly growing domestic markets. He directed the capital that led to the industrialization of the United States. American industrialists got rich. European investors got rich. America was transformed, and his share of each transaction ensured that Morgan became wealthy as well.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists, early round investors in new companies and firms that underwrite their initial public offerings all facilitate the creation of new companies and the creation of jobs and wealth, and profit from it. Early investors in Microsoft, Google (nasdaq: GOOG - news - people ), Oracle (nasdaq: ORCL - news - people ) and Apple (nasdaq: AAPL - news - people ) all profited quite handsomely from it.</p>
<p>This used to be the principal function of Wall Street firms other than those principally in retail brokerage. But it produces individual Wall Street executive wealth only slowly, and only when Wall Street produces increases in national wealth. Patient men like Warren Buffett still facilitate wealth creation, and Buffett may be richer even than Gates.</p>
<p>–Steal it. Stealing money is much more reliable than earning it. You can steal wealth slowly, the old-fashioned way, buried within the operations of trading for the house account. Or you can steal it quickly, by using obscure and poorly understood financial artifacts to produce the illusion of wealth creation. Then you take a piece of the illusionary wealth, as personal cash, now. Then you exit and duck for cover before the entire game blows up. Better yet, you can sell your private equity firm to naïve investors for one final twist of the knife into the carcass of your nation. (Deliberate fraud, like those allegedly committed by Bernie Madoff or Robert Allen Stanford, is too crude to be of interest to young financial engineers, and too likely to result in extreme punishment.)</p>
<p>I then suggested that if students were not interested in earning their money through entrepreneurship (too risky), then investment banking in China offered the next best alternative for personal wealth creation. Facilitating investment in, and growth of, companies catering to the wants, needs, cravings and longings of China’s growing middle class, offers Chinese investment bankers a path toward personal wealth by creating national wealth, much as J. P. Morgan did for America.</p>
<p>The students, though, were uninterested in banking in China. After the students left, it took my colleagues and me a couple of hours to figure out why this was so. I-banking in China is about improving China. The students saw i-banking in America as being about improving their own personal wealth, first and foremost; if the client could be assisted without too much personal inconvenience then and only then did they see American i-banking as also being about value creation.</p>
<p>I asked myself, What have we done? When I thought that the craze for private equity careers and investment banking careers among the brightest Western students was the fault of Western business schools, I felt both shame (for perhaps having contributed to this) and fear (for how we as a nation could possibly compete with foreign nations where the best and brightest young students sought real careers).</p>
<p>Perhaps the fear was unwarranted. Perhaps the best and the brightest students of other nations also wish to transform their homelands from economic dragons into paper tigers, following the Western model. Interestingly, our own students are indeed learning to manage, learning to market, learning operations and production planning and logistics; they are working hard to get ready for a world of things. Perhaps America doesn’t have as much to fear from foreign competition as we thought.</p>

<hr>
<p>My 2 cents:</p>
<p>I think between the time stamp on this article and today, there’s been a slight change in sentiment of Chinese students to investment banking careers in China - it’s “cool” now to work for CICC or CITIC. Probably even cooler than working for non-bulge bracket American or European banks.</p>
<p>The Chinese always had a thing for prestige. Prestige probably outweigh how much money you’re making, how much time you’re working, how much illegal activities are going on under the table, or any other factor that concerns a job hunter who is Chinese. The same thing applies for college selections. Harvard is the only school worth going to - or so my dad thinks.</p>
<p>So CICC and CITIC became “cool” now, because they became prestigious.</p>
<p>Working for a domestic Chinese PE firm is “cool” now for the same reason.</p>
<p>Prestige comes down to one thing - how we look in the eyes of others. To live a happy and fulfilling life is to live a happy and fulfilling life in the eyes of others. To be rich is to be rich in the eyes of others. To be powerful is to be powerful in the eyes of others.</p>
<p>To <strong>be</strong>, is to be in the eyes of others.</p>
<p>This is our generation. A generation of so many Chinese in most places around the world that one finds little space to live outside of the eyes of others. If escaped, one is considered outcast in the eyes of others. One is boxed, and if one is claustrophobic one might wish that one wasn’t born Chinese. Think, if only one had golden locks and blue eyes, one would look “special” in the eyes of the Chinese by default - no further action is necessary.</p>
<p>Vain.</p>
<p>The excess of this country is sure evident to every single person who can spend more than 100RMB per head on a meal. Because from there you can see the guy who can spend 200RMB, and his friend who can spend 300RMB, and on we go - the sky is the limit.</p>
<p>But on second thought, the students in the story who wanted Wall Street investment banking jobs are goal-oriented and direct because they cared to visit Wharton. The bright students of Tsinghua or PKU or any other academic institutions in China who are not interested in Wall Street investment banking jobs probably don’t even know what Wharton is. They probably won’t pay thousands of dollars to go to the US to meet bankers. They would be visiting labs and research centers in places like MIT, Stanford, Silicon Valley. On sponsored money.</p>
<p>The best and the brightest of this country don’t all want investment banking jobs on Wall Street. But if they are spending years in the lab or doing grass-root NGO work they need to still make a living. It should be the government’s job to make sure that the best and the brightest can afford building the society by creating real <strong><em>things</em></strong>. CSR can help with that as well.</p>

    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">

      
      

      
        
          
            <p>Ever since I became a Kindle user a few months ago, I’ve developed a few thoughts on the effect of e-books on traditional print media. The general effect is quite apparent to most: E-books make print media much less desirable.</p>
<div>In my view, there are two main trends that are the key drivers for this shift:</div><br><div></div><br><div>1. The Internet:</div><br><div>There’s been a steady movement from print media to online media in general over the past decade. Printing was no longer the ONLY way of making content available, and more and more content are being published online. People are using computers more and more to access information, replacing reading books/magazines/newspapers, watching TV, even talking to people, etc. All of one’s information-gathering experience can be moved to the computer in a centralized fashion. As access to computers become easier, fewer people rely on print media for information. Simply put, we’ve got options.</div><br><div></div><br><div>2. The Mobile Devices:</div><br><div>There’s been a boom in the number of mobile devices that allow for access to e-books. Technology (think the iPhone, Amazon Kindle, and other mobile devices) are allowing people access to content without physically being in front of a computer. This means even less of a demand for print media. Cell phone screens are getting better, new display technology is allowing for better reading experiences, battery life is lasting longer, and distribution networks are becoming more established (like the iTunes store or the Amazon book store that can wirelessly deliver books/newspapers/magazines/blogs to the reading devices). This means that those people who could not be in front of a computer all the time can now access all that information wirelessly on a mobile device. This means that the ONLY competitive advantage that print media once had over online media - mobility - is also gone.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Other, smaller factors:</div><br><div></div><br><div>3. Save paper:</div><br><div>A small, but complimentary factor is that companies and corporations are called on by activists to go “green” and save paper. The global “green” movement means that things that people used to get in paper (delivery of bills, advertisement, coupons to shop at local stores, etc.) are also being taken online. Fewer people check their mails daily, because most of what you can get in a mail are being moved to the virtual space to save paper.</div><br><div></div><br><div>4. The social factor</div><br><div>Social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Renren, Sina microblog, are allowing people to gather information and give instant feedback to demonstrate personality and identity to others. Would you rather read a funny article and laugh to yourself and then forget about it, or would you rather post it on your Renren and Twitter and have your friends (or “fans”) comment on it? The result can be that you feel like a more popular and interesting person. This social experience makes online media irreplaceable by print media. Yes, and vanity sells.</div><br><div></div><br><div>5. IP protection</div><br><div>The biggest problem with online media was intellectual property protection - how do you stop someone from sharing your content somewhere else? This is one big reason why the New York Times and Wall Street Journal changed over to paid online subscription instead of free content. Yes, you can get the same news everywhere, but you only get the fastest and most reliable news by subscribing to the most well-known news sources. Also, if books, magazines, etc. are now offered on the iTunes store and Amazon book store, publishers are more likely to go to them for distribution because their IP are protected (for example, you can’t just buy a book on the Kindle and send it to someone else’s computer).</div><br><div></div><br><div>So another question to consider would be this: Will print media ever disappear? Probably not.</div><br><div></div><br><div>1. Secure storage - you can lose all your data on the computer, but you are less likely to lose a book because internet viruses can’t eat paper.</div><br><div></div><br><div>2. Physical/historic value - the author can sign his/her book, but can’t sign the e-book. A collector might have a room full of Japanese cartoons, but you if it’s all digital in a harddrive then it’s probably worth nothing.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Although e-books are seriously hurting the businesses relying on print media, the trend will create more opportunities for online distributors, IT companies, mobile device manufacturers, and smaller publishers (since it’s now much cheaper to publish something online). Print media will still have a place, just a much smaller one. Fewer jobs in the print factory, but more jobs in the IT and journalism areas.  This is a good trend, and one that will create a better digital information experience for readers worldwide.</div><br><div></div><br><div>Now let’s all get Kindles =).</div>

            <p>年夜饭，春晚，祝福短信。。。从1999年夏季到温哥华至今，已经有一个多decade没在武汉过过年了。</p>
<p>在这儿，也来点年度总结吧：</p>
<p>2010年嘛，总的来说。。。挺不错。没神马伤心事儿，到挺多开心事儿。还有几件喜事儿。这运气越走到年尾就越好了。种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆，此话充分的在这一年当中体现了出来。</p>
<p>年初的纽约，年中的香港，年末的北京，这一路上有太多的人和事未能一一感谢，回味，high，小酌，叙旧，怀旧，念旧，在此我也只能说，下次在（某城市）再会！</p>
<p>这一年结识了不少朋友，让我本就很严重的中国情结越发深刻，越发不可自拔。数年前原本是想留在国外的我，逐渐想：以后得回国！逐渐想：立刻得回国！逐渐想：现在回来就不走了！</p>
<p>2010年说是中国经济的“转变”年。在我看，中国的转变就是世界的转变，就是GCC的转变，就是我和我的同类的转变。未来很难说到底会怎么样，但是我相信明天会比今天好，我们在中国的未来也会越来越好。</p>
<p>在这里，祝大家在新的一年里，登上新高，飞黄腾达！</p>
