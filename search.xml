      <content type="text"><![CDATA[今晚跟一个从华尔街回国的朋友聊天，发现金融圈跑出来创业的人，在学生时代都拥有一个共同标签：特别能忽悠。 其实很make sense。会忽悠的人在融资、营销、销售、挖人这些初创阶段比较重要的事情上都颇有优势，所以很容易感觉表面繁华。 但是，会忽悠的人往往产品做得稀烂，Retention几乎为0。这可能是中国创业者和美国创业者最大的不同。 很可惜，我在学生时代并没有这样的标签，所以只能靠后天补勤了。]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[##问题：Turbolinks在帮助页面加速（不去重新加载已经加载过的物件）的时候，JS指令“document.ready”不会被引发，所以根据该指令产生的jQuery动作也不会执行。在网站页面不多、物件不复杂的时候，直接干掉Turbolinks是可行的（也是之前写的一篇教学中所推荐的），但当页面越来越多，加载速度越来越慢的时候，使用Turbolinks变得十分重要，所以需要将”document.ready”修改成一个Turbolinks会发出的指令。 ##解决方案： 将123$(document).ready(function() //YOUR FUNCTION); 修改为123$(document).on("turbolinks:load", function() //YOUR FUNCTION); 记住要加回Turbolinks： application.js1//= require turbolinks 这样页面的指令就会在正常执行了。 参考：http://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html#turbolinks]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[今天的两件事情我觉得比较值得回味。 第一件就是Xdite分享了接案公司的运营。第二件是晚上去一个朋友的局被好友劝说去大公司工作。 1. 接案公司是我昨天晚上在班上提出的一个想法，为的是解决我们很多人在课程结束后还渴望继续练习，同时需要找工作产生收入的需求。联合开一个接案公司可以解决这个问题，一方面有项目可以继续练习，另一方面又可以开始有收入。与此同时，接案公司在台湾碰到的两大瓶颈：人才短缺和市场太小，在大陆都不是问题。 但今天早上，Xdite老师分享了接案公司的心得后，这一条路似乎又看起来没有那么promising。核心点在于接案公司的盈利能力很大程度上取决于客户。好客户想法不变、修改不多、按时付费、结算尾款。坏客户朝三暮四、各种改动、拖延付款、尾款坏账。在这种行业里，公司的收入是浮动的（案子有时多有时少 + 付款是被动的），但开销却是固定的（程序员工资 + 房租），所以很容易在市场不景气或者客户不靠谱的时候拖垮一家公司，或者至少说接案的钱并没有那么好赚。 就这样，我们从约饭、VPN到接案三个不同idea的迅速转移又回到了原点。 2. 今天晚上，我跟几个很久没见的朋友们喝东西。我现在已经不隐瞒学编程这件事情了。如我所料，其中两位朋友开始说6万块如何不值，如何用3个程序员4万工资2个礼拜就开发出来了两个角色两个版本的iOS App。另外一个朋友拉着我聊了许久，觉得我应该去一个大的科技公司工作几年再创业，认为独自干的学习成本太高，不如积累好资源、想清楚再干。 Well，这些东西我在过去半年里，已经反复想过很多遍了。 技术可不可以外包？当然可以。作为一个推荐所有创业者“能外包的东西尽量外包”的人，我为什么会想不开，自己去学最难学会的那个本可以外包的东西？因为我需要在连4万块工资都开不起的时候把东西做出来。我已经很清楚地看到，MVP不是做一次就结束了，而是需要不断修改，甚至做很多次才能完善的东西。而创业idea，更是有可能快速失败后快速更换。所以即便在资本寒冬之后程序员外包成本急剧下降，没有钱想要聘人写一版又一版的程序是不现实的。 另外说一下去大公司这一点。 如果我打算用未来两年时间摸索创业，而我面临的选择是A：去BAT/GFA工作两年，还是B：连续创业失败3次？我会选B。很多人可能永远无法理解，唯一让你“创业能力”更强的工作，就是创业。去大公司积累人脉、看准需求、看好趋势，都比不上在创业过程中用实际的产品去碰撞实际的需求。 以上。]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[如何正确的面对自己？ 起笔写这个心得，比我想象中要难好多。 我其实并不是一个喜欢研究如何“学习”的人，或者说我在较早的时候就已经经历了迷恋研究如何学习的时期。我在大一的时候痴迷于GTD，买了很多书，给自己做了inbox、文件夹、各种todo list、用了各种App（那个时候就用了第一版经常闪退的Evernote Beta），后来发现效率的确有提升，但并没有那么“神奇”，和我自己持续正常努力的结果可能不会有太大差距。也可能是因为从小就足够会学习，家里满墙奖状、高中当选学生会主席、哥伦比亚大学提前录取、本科毕业就年薪百万，这些对我来说虽然不算轻而易举，但真的也没那么难。我是个典型的实践主义者：Just do it。思考，远没有执行来的有快感。 我也不是不擅长写字。我7年前就开了自己的博客，从高盛辞职的时候写过整个金融圈都看到过的“我为何离开香港”，在知乎上过去一年也积累了接近一万个粉丝。但我不喜欢写日记。也不擅长总结自己学习的过程或方法论。我比较擅长的是分享人生阅历、在每一个人生节点为什么做出和别人不太一样的决定的思考，或者对最近所观察到的事情做出自己的一些看法和总结。换句话说，一篇文章对我来说更像是一个会被展示的项目，而不是一段文字记录或思路整理。这是个我仍需要克服的问题。 在”Just Do It”的模式下运行惯了的我，却发现在创业这件事情上并行不通。在过去两年中，我尝试过两次互联网创业，享受了融资成功、百人团队、9个月烧掉一千万的盛世，也体验过产品零增长、融资失败、合伙人撕逼、团队解散的挫败。长这么大第一次深刻意识到，再漂亮的简历、再牛逼的背景、再花哨的西装、再强大的自我包装能力，在市场面前，完全没有任何卵用。 你可以说我是一个自以为是的over-achiever，一个精致的利己主义者，一个创业动机不纯的wantrepreneur——我曾经100%是，直到现在一部分的我，可能还是。 通常，和我类似背景的人在碰到上述困难的时候，会选择去读MBA，准确的说是哈佛、沃顿、斯坦福的MBA。但当我脑海中闪过这样的念头的时，我会立刻将其抹杀，因为我不需要再多一个名校标签，被潜意识的逃避所屈服，两年后回到远点，再一次思考工作vs.创业的窘境。 所以我选择了面对。面对自己的失败的最大好处，就是让所有心高气傲的想法统统被干掉。全栈营开学第一天，我没有要做队长，甚至在前两周都没有说什么话。我告诉自己，我就是个什么都不懂的初学者，我需要做的唯一一件事，就是学。所以，能够让我真正进入学习状态的，不是智商或勤奋，而是抛开了我的傲慢。 创业失败了，所以呢？ 创业失败后的总结过程中，我越来越认为创业不是需要去理解多么高阶、深奥、复杂的理论，而是将一些非常简单又基本的原则真正去实践。以下是我认为在所读过的文字中最能够概括创业所需的基本原则： Companies create X amount of value, and capture Y% of X（创造价值X，然后获取X里面的Y%占比）. Avoid competition and always try to monopolize a small market（避免竞争，尽可能垄断一个微小市场）. The best way to think of startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It’s to look for problems, preferrably problems you have yourself（思考创业点子的最好办法就是不要去想创业点子，而是去找寻问题，最好是你自己正面临的问题）. The best startup ideas tent to have three things in common（最好的创业点子拥有以下特征）: a. they’re something the founders themselves want（是创始人自己想要的东西） b. that they themselves can build（是创始人可以创造的东西） c. and that few others realize are worth doing（而且很少其他人会认为这件东西有价值）. 前两条来自Peter Thiel 2012年在斯坦福的创业课，后来被整理写入他的书《从零到一》，后两条来自Paul Graham的博客，同样写于2012年。 这些原则可能会是我下一次创业的指南针，但其中有一个很大的缺口：4.b——创始人需要自己能够打造自己想要用来解决问题的产品。 而这，也正是我学编程的原因。 过去两年，我看到了太多创业者在开发上所浪费的时间、精力、钱，最终打造出来设计丑、体验差、没人用的产品。选择创业是为了给世界创造价值，而这样的创业只会摧毁价值。 我没有对身边的任何人提我要去学编程这件事情。他们不会那么容易理解，我也懒得浪费时间去解释自己。在获得了我唯一需要的支持后（我的家人），我就报名了全栈营。 全栈营是什么鬼？ 刚来全栈营的时候，我是怀疑的。经验告诉我，大部分告诉你能够速成的东西都是骗人的。 我不知道Ruby on Rails是什么。我查了网上的解释，还是不知道Ruby on Rails是什么。我听过Github无数次，甚至之前创业的iOS代码就备份在Github上，但我不知道一行Github指令，也不说不出Github是什么。我上一次写代码，是13岁的时候为了让自己的MySpace能够更好看一些，勉强用HTML调整了背景图、字体、颜色。所以对，我也不知道CSS是什么，因为没用过。 7个星期的项目成果，大概是长这样： 【第一个项目：贴吧，开学前两周独立完成】 【第二个项目：论坛，开学前独立完成】 【第三个项目：招聘网站，独立6天完成】 【第四个项目：电商，独立8天完成】 【第五个项目：投票游戏，2人2天完成的Hackathon】 【第六个项目：约饭平台，5人15个工作日完成】 如果说我曾经怀疑自己成为一个全栈工程师的潜力，在做完这6个项目之后，我不再有任何怀疑。尽管我现在还不足以称自己为“全栈”，但我已经具备了开发最基础功能的web + mobile前端和后端技能（从这里延伸到iOS/Android也提供了快捷的方法和教材）。更重要的是，我已经拥有了自学开发任何其他简单功能的基础。不喜欢写日记的我，也攒下了近60篇博客，其中约10篇是关于开发某个功能的方法或总结。 不得不承认，在“把学生教会”这一件事上，全栈营做到了。 所以Ruby on Rails到底是什么？ 如果一个程序是一个世界，那么程序员就是建造这个世界的神。《创世记》中，神说：“要有光”，就有了光。但神是如何获得制作光的工具？万一光子并不知道如何连接在一起让光线可以从A照射到B呢？万一被光照射到的地方并无法反光所以透露不出自己的颜色呢？人只看得到光，所以认为神可以用一句话让光出现，但人并不知道神是这么造光的。 神要创造光，需要两样东西：给光下达指令的方式，和下达指令的框架。前者可以使任何神和光都懂的语言，而后者，是让神在写任何东西的时候都可以快速高效的写出来，而不需要去担心存放东西空间的大小、里面的物质等其他琐碎却复杂的细节。 所以，在这个世界里： 神=程序员 光=程序 人=用户 神对光下达指令的方式=Ruby 神创造任何东西的框架=Rails 写程序的人非常多，程序非常多，语言也非常多，但为什么说Ruby on Rails会比其他方式更快？因为Rails对神想要做的事情做了很多的预估和猜测，设计了一系列方便神去创造的框架细节。就像在一个锅碗瓢盆因有尽有的厨房炒菜和跟在一个什么都需要去买的厨房炒菜是完全不一样的。Rails就是那个连新鲜调味料都帮你备好的厨房。 7个星期中具体都学到了些什么？ 在过去一段时间的学习中，我最大的surprise就是Rails有多么的简单。回顾日记，我可以清楚的看到自己是在哪一天学到了什么：开始学会用Google自己搜教学完成某个功能（第3天…）、如何写seed文档（第4天）、上传附件（第6天）、理解migration和重建db（第8天）、自由搭建routes（第9天）、写CRUD以外的新action（第11天）、自动发邮件（第13天）、装状态机（第14天）、使用AWS存储文件（第15天）、用Figaro保护AWS云服务（第16天）、如何规划Hackathon的超短线开发、做Landing Page（第20天）。 从第五周起（第21天）我们进入团队开发模式，项目管理和协作变成了首要学习要点，也就是从这里开始真正模拟实战开发项目的场景。没有什么产品会是一个人独立写出来的，而无法协作的人一定无法成为好的程序员。也是在这个时候，我开始觉得我的小宇宙爆发了。从写User Story、在Redmine上切票、写Onboarding文档，到写前端、做demo，都在一定程度上发挥了我的罗辑思维能力、项目管理能力和视觉审美。我们团队也顺利成为全班进度最快、产品最完整的团队。 8周6万的课，是否值得？ 人在衡量一段经历的价值的时候会展现出惊人的认知偏差。成果令人开心的事情价值很容易抬高，反之则无论前面体验如何都会变的不值；自己选择的事情很容易觉得宝贵，被强迫的选择很容易不值；经过千辛万苦被虐到废的经历会十分珍惜，轻易得来的东西则不那么在乎。所以当我们问一个人某段经历是否值得的时候，100个人会有100种答案。 按照我创业前工资来算，过去2个月的机会成本大概是26万人民币。但我在很早之前就已经放弃了按月计算机会成本的短视角。因为这样算的人，永远不会离开高薪打工的岗位去尝试任何带有较高风险的事情。打工和创业，就像是债权回报和股权回报的对比。买债券拿到的是每月的固定收益（工资），而股权回报可以几年不分红甚至亏损，而在未来的某一天腾飞，获得几十甚至上百倍的回报。 从一个技术的门外汉，到能独立开发极简程序、共同开发完整可上线程序，能够看懂Stackoverflow上的交流贴并自己实现没有做过的新功能、解决没有碰到过的bug，这一切对我来说，其实已经远远超出了我对自己“程序员”身份的假想。有很多人会去花时间选择编程语言，甚至去网上跟人撕哪一种语言更好。在这一点上quote一句老人的话“不管黑猫白猫，捉到老鼠就是好猫”。 在我上一次创业当中，开发一款iOS的App，从立项到内测花了近4个月时间，用了1个iOS、1个后端、1个后端实习生、1个产品经理、1个外包设计师、1个全职设计师，开了几十万的工资。而现在的我，再继续练习1-2个月之后，可以1个人完成那6个人做的所有事情。 但在这里学到比编程更有价值的，是关于创业的一些best practice和know-how。Landing Page, User Story, 项目管理，Growth Hacking…如果说编程让我创业的成功率从1%上升到了2%，那么这些其他的知识可能让2%成为了5%（虽然实际情况可能这些概率都得再除以10，哈哈哈）。 结论 在过去半年里，我拒绝了来自投行、PE的offer，以及来自影视行业、医药行业、创业公司CFO的橄榄枝。无论是投资人还是创业者，下注小概率事件的人都是有一定赌性。既然只能下注一次，为什么不博一把大点的呢？]]></content>

      <url>%2F2016%2F12%2F04%2F2016-12-04-front-end-summary%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[过去两周team基本进入了前后端共同推进阶段，而我作为组内设计元素的主要贡献者，不可避免的花了大量时间写前端。这不是我想做的，因为学技术的目的是希望能够自主开发更多功能，但为了项目推进，必须要实现最大化每个人的产值，同时也是对自己前端HTML、CSS很好的练习。 两周前端写下来，分享一下自己的体会： ##前端和后端一样需要提前规划 我在之前的一篇日记中提到过，在项目进行到一定程度，MVC需要提前规划再写入。前端开发其实在荧幕适配这个问题上是类似的。由于我们项目从一开始只想到了电脑荧幕适配，所以没有写入任何的小荧幕适配CSS。这就导致在之后写入这代码的时候需要修改大量以前的代码，排版和CSS定义越多的地方修改越大。 由于Bootstrap提供了非常便利的responsive grid system，所以其实在一开始写的时候就应该想好两套适配模式：电脑和移动端，基本可以用Bootstrap上的col-md-XX和col-xs-XX覆盖。而只有需要罗列大量物件的地方才需要考虑使用col-lg-XX和其他大小的适配。 另外，如果所有页面都通过Bootstrap nav tab以及render partial的方式呈现，可以让使用的时候几乎没有任何跳转（“设计师”项目应该就是这样设计的，所有页面都是partial的形态存在views/common下面）。但同样，这种写法需要一开始就定好，因为之后修改的时候营业面需要将view里面的定义通过controller重新确定，越往后越麻烦。 ##前端的核心不是技术，是审美和时间 之前以为技术大牛朋友跟我说过，后端决定了项目的底线，前端决定了项目的上线。虽然不是100%完全认同，但基本上表达了项目前后端的角色。前端不需要对编程有深刻的理解，不需要对项目管理有详细的规划，只需要懂得如何通过HTML/CSS/jQuery来实现视觉上的效果。而且有了Bootstrap、jQuery、HTML5、CSS3等便捷语言的出现，在开发模式下其实想要调整前端也非常容易。 但前端却是可以非常耗时间的意向工作。每实现一个新的视觉效果、生成一个新的页面，都需要花大量的时间去编排。甚至套模板也不是很便捷，因为大部分模板都是为基本的HTML、CSS而写，都不那么智能，在根据自己网站需求套上之后如果要加效果还得另行写入。 所以如Xdite所做的，前端完全可以外包给一个专业点的设计师，同时有一个in-house胜任者就可以完成。 ##珍惜时间，远离APP 下周希望学习高瑞是如何用15秒生成“法律在线”项目App的，然后如果整个产品都是JS + Partial的形式，基本上不会有太多页面跳转，使用起来跟App的体验是差不多的。App开发时，手机荧幕大小的适配、App Store的认证、审核，都会耗费大量的时间和精力，在创业早期，能不碰就千万别碰。]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[刚开始学习HTML / CSS / Rails的时候，有两个工具，是我很希望一开始就学会如何使用的： 前端： Google Chrome自带的Developer Tools，快捷键是Cmd + Opt + I，或者如果直接想用鼠标找到页面上想要调整的物件可以用Cmd + Opt + C。 当发现页面的东西显示不对的时候，打开Cmd + Opt + C，用鼠标找到想要修改的物件，找到左手边HTML文件里相对应的部分，点击，然后找到右手边”style”部分里面的相对应的CSS代码，可以直接修改定义的色值、大小、排版等，也可以直接在左手边HTML里面修改HTML产生效果变动。 后端： 之前文章说过gem “pry”很好用，最近开始用这个gem调出所想要找到的路径和数据，比如在有关联的两组数据，用第一组数据找到第二组数据的某个数值。 举例：在feedbacks index页面里，想要把所有的@feedbacks中找到跟该feedback管理的order创立的时间：1234&lt;% binding.pry %&gt;&lt;% @feedbacks.each do |feedback| %&gt; &lt;%= OrderTwo.find(feedback.order_two_id).created_at.strftime("%d %b %Y")%&gt;&lt;% end %&gt; 本来并不会写中间那行代码，但可以用pry找到feedback，然后知道feedback里面存有order_two的id，而这个id是可以用来调用OrderTwo这个object的。 另外，第二行代码后面的strftime也是一个很好用的时间格式method，比to_s要好用。这里有一个简单的教程。]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective 关于今天的课程, 你记得什么? Xdite讲了关于Onboarding的课程，非常受用。发现自己用过好多觉得不错的互联网产品都具有Onboarding性质的引导。 完成了什么? 今天完成了Eatgether项目的第二轮demo，整体表现满意。 Reflective 今天的高峰是什么? Demo前接受了上周的经验，为了不受到其他团队项目影响我的情绪，我没有看功能上可能比我们厉害的项目，而是专心在思考怎么掩饰我们组的项目。 今天的低点是什么? 下午太困了，效率很低，基本除了整理Redmine和列举新的任务之后没有做什么其他事情。 Interpretive 我们今天学到了什么? Onboarding引导非常重要，下周需要立刻开始学习执行。 今天一个重要的领悟是什么? 我们今天分享本周收获和坑的stand up meeting中，团员们基本上都谈到了团队协作的事情。我们一致认为，我们组能够如期完成任务，主要是因为拥有较好的团队协作，每个队员都有把团队利益放在自身利益前面的作风，所有工作都以结果为导向、以效率为最重要指标，把情绪和不满统统放在一边，用成果说话。 在以前的投行领域，尽管团队协作也非常重要，但基本上都存在上下级汇报关系，有老板愿意陪你多加班几个小时就很开心，帮你干手上的活简直感动的都想流泪。但在编程领域，团队协作几乎是整个项目进度的命脉，别说一起加班了，大家互相需要不断教会对方新的技巧、debug、甚至包括传授完成某项task时的思维方式。非常喜欢编程领域的扁平化模式和meritocracy，之后更有时间了会写多一些这方面的体会发到自己的公众号上。 Decisional 我们会如何用一句话形容今天的工作 十分充实。 有哪些工作需要明天继续努力? 周末还有挺多小功能需要完善，在下周一前需要部署完毕到Heroku任务还是比较多的。 非常期待Onboarding的练习。]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective-客观性 从今天起写中文，不装逼了。 今天成功完成了demo。为了顺利完成demo，我们昨天临时将部分还未完善的功能临时删除处理，例如Feedback的修改、删除，OrderTwo在邀约方后台无法查看等。下午我们花了很多时间深度分享了一下本周作为团队一起做项目的第一个星期。 Reflective-反应性 直到昨天晚上，整个组的还是士气高昂的。可能是因为老师一直在夸奖我们的前端完整度，所以我们一直以为自己走在整个cohort的前面。但今天demo的时候才发现，原来好几个团队不仅将前端也用简单大方的视觉方式展现，同时也实现了一些我们尚未实现的功能（如五星打分、聊天框等）。这让最后一组展示的我们有些措手不及，也影响了demo时的临时表现。尽管团队认为demo的整体效果和逻辑还是不错的，但在presentation方面其实可以做到更好。 Interpretive-诠释性 下午分享会时，我分享了本周最大的收获和最大的坑： 最大收获 本周最大收获当属深刻意识到提前规划的重要性。不仅仅是宏观层面从项目的目的、目标、功能的排期和分工而言，而在微观层面，个人对功能实现时的提前思考也是非常重要的。 举例而言，在实现Feedback功能时，由于之前很多时候都是一步步根据老师教程写入代码，所以习惯性在写入Feedback model之后直接就开始写Feedback的controller里的CRUD，并没有思考属于account下和admin下的Feedback controller，并且在写Feedback的view的时候也是想到一个页面写一个。 因此，尽管Feedback初步功能实现了，但MVC之间的功能非常混乱，有的CRUD action是多余的、有的view页面是不会用到的。 后来我在上传第一版Feedback功能的git之后，在纸上将Feedback功能所需要的MVC重新梳理了一遍，然后根据规划好的布局从top-down开始先建立controller里的action，然后添加和删除view的页面，最后再来将这些action和页面里的代码写出来，重新上传。 最大的坑 本周最大的是在routing方面。其实在这周之前我一直不够了解routes.rb文件和所有路由线路的关系。比如哪些resources会出现在多个namespace下面。之前的认知还停留在知道新的model需要作为resources，这样才能撰写CRUD，但没有明白如果是一个resources下（比如orders）下面再有隶属的resources（比如feedbacks）应该如何应对。 双重resources会影响整个MVC流程，但更难的其实是在不同的view里面如何传正确的路径和路径所指的数据。比如，在account/order_twos/index.html.erb里面，如果要调用除了order以外的数据，在path里面不能像之前比较简单的架构下只需要找到path(order)那样，而需要提供两个数值： 如果routes如下： Feedback的controller如下：1234def edit @order = OrderTwo.find(params[:order_two_id]) @feedback = current_user.feedbacks.find(params[:id])end 而此时想要在order_two的controller下找到edit的路径，则需要这样写：1234567&lt;% @order_twos.each do |order| %&gt;...&lt;% order.feedbacks.where(:user_id =&gt; current_user).each do |feedback| %&gt;...&lt;%= link_to(&quot;修改反馈&quot;, edit_account_order_two_feedback_path(order.id, feedback.id), class: &quot;btn btn-sm btn-default outline&quot;) %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt;&lt;% end %&gt; 以上代码是在同一页面上，在每一个order_two下面的每一个order.feedback里找到edit的路径。这里的重点在于edit路径中的(order.id, feedback.id），因为在route中这里需要两个数值：1/account/order_twos/:order_two_id/feedbacks/:id/edit 所以提供的第一个是order的id，第二个是feedback的id（感谢梁超教会我这里括号内信息的意思）。 Decisional-决定性 本周初步开始从“把教程中的代码套用到新的项目上”进入“自己理解后根据需求修改代码”，非常有成就感的一步。下周开始我们会用两天时间Eatgether所有的功能，接下来的时间会用于将显示出来的信息正常化，将整个网站美化，可能会调用团队的整体精力从后端逐步转移到前段。]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective Today we were told there will be a demo day tomorrow to show case our project. We got pretty nervous and spent a lot of time cutting down time spent on building new features and allocated a lot more resources on improving existing features and rendering better layouts and visuals. In the end, we decided to allocate the day time to working separately on improving features and then group together after dinner to merge all the git branches together and enter some dummie data for demo purposes. Reflective So I had been stuck on the feedback feature’s deleting function for a day, and Xdite told me to write a new ticket and table it for now. I did that, but because we are also building a new model for order_two (allowing users to request pairing with someone rather than admin pairing users together), this created a lot of problems when merging feedback, which has belongs_to relationships with both users and orders (now order_twos), which meant we had to change a lot of routes and controller commands. By the end of the day we still couldn’t figure out all the linkages to add feedback as a full-CRUD feature, so we decided to take out some features like deletion and editing for demo day. I spent most of my afternoon improving visuals of the site, including finding a font for the company name/logo, changing color scheme of the navbar, and redoing the layouts of all user and admin’s console pages. I was pretty pleased with how the layouts turned out in the end. Interpretive I learned the importance of writing clean codes today as during merging we had a lot of conflicts, and it wasn’t always clear which codes were doing what. I got a chance to look at Liang Chao’s code for installing JQuery command for “five-star rating”, and he made sure to comment at places where codes looked confusing. Also in terms of routing, which I have been picking up a lot on by doing the feedback feature, I am still at the point where I can only read a few lines of code to understand why they were written that way, and replicate code structures from a previous project to the current project. I am not at a point where I can write fresh code to do CRUD actions in a complex relationship situation. My teammate Han Han seems to be very good at this, and I really look forward to learning more from him. Decisional Today was productive and the team all worked very hard together. We have managed to put together a visually-pleasing and functionally-passable product together for demo. Let’s see how we do tomorrow.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective Today we went over User Story again and came up with a series of tasks, which would change our app from a site where admins matched users on dates, to users (“askers”) requesting dates and having post owners (“posters”) deciding who to pick. The most important of which were: building an asker_request relationship that askers would generate once they request a date; building a separate order_two model that would hold 1 post (date, which includes 1 user who posted the post) and 1 user (asker). Other tasks involved further enhancing webpage views, connecting various pages and adding to forms, building an interests model to hold interest tags of users, as well as making the feedback model more usable. My main focus has been on the feedback model. I’m nearly done but still has one but yet to be fixed regarding deletion (I believe). Reflective Today was bad because it’s my second time being late to our morning meeting, prompting everyone to ask me what’s going on. I have a chronic bad habit of staying up late, and it’s something I really really really need to fix. For this reason I’m going to leave my computer at the classroom so that I can go home and sleep right away tonight. With regards to the project, I learned a lot about routing and CRUD today through practice. My first version of feedback MVC was terribly written with many unused CRUD actions in different controllers, and view files that weren’t being accessed - it was all over the place. I saved a version and restarted the MVC codes, only this time I wrote down before hand which pages needed to be made and which actions were needed in which controllers. This made things much more clear and I was able to get all the URLs to display correctly (e.g. admin/order/5/feedback/2/edit, instead of admin/feedback/2/edit). However, there is still an issue outstanding whereby if the admin deletes a feedback in the console, then when a new feedback is written it cannot be found by the current code (off by 1 id). I’ve worked on this the past couple hours to no avail. Hopefully we can figure this out tomorrow. Interpretive A key learning today was the importance to plan ahead when writing controllers that are accessed by multiple namespaces, it’s simply too confusing if you code on the fly. Another key learning today was how to submit form info into a specific route. So we’ve learned from rails101 project that if you want to submit to posts under groups, then the form should have form_for [@group,@post] do |post|. And yesterday we figured out that to submit under a namespace would be form_for [:admin,@post] do |post|. Combining the two together we’d get [form_for [:admin,@order,@feedback] do |feedback| for something to be submitted in namespace “admin” and under an “order” resources. Decisional Today was very challenging in general given both a bad start and a tough problem to tackle. Tomorrow I’ll get the day started early and hopefully crack the feedback CRUD issue.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective Today we discussed the User Story further and came up with a number of tasks that could be added to the existing project. The tasks were mainly around posts and admin views. I took on the tasks of adding in the OrderMailer where appropriate, as well as adding in a new model for feedback which is something the users add every time a meeting took place, the content of which will be used to generate a “experiences page” later on. Reflective Generating the mailer was more difficult than I expected, as this time I wanted to be more thorough. For instance, in our current app, we have 2 individuals meeting. Once they’re assigned, an automated message should be sent to 2 people instead of 1. Also, when a meeting sucessfully takes place, the congratulatory email should also be bcc-ed to admins so we know an order is complete. The feedback model was also much more challenging than expected. As both user and admin needed to access and edit feedbacks in their control panels, there needed be 3 controllers, each with certain parts of CRUD and also some view pages to go with the controllers. Interpretive I learned about manipulating the form code to [:admin, @feedbacks] to have path for information entered through admin/feedbacks_controller. Also learned to assign 2 email addresses to a variable and then call that variable in Mailer to send to multiple people, and the code to find all admin emails is @admin_recipients = @admin.select(:email).map(&amp;:email). Also just felt in general I can create CRUD much faster than before. Because we are now in new territory from previous projects, a lot of the times we are left on our own to de-bug a certain issue. This requires me to be more familiar with the rails console, which I am still learning. Decisional Today was productive but we’ve come to realization of certain parts of our app that’s going to be very difficult to build, such as expanding to a 2 x 2 functionality. We will plow through the week to get all the basics done with 1 x 1 functions and see if we can work on a 2 x 2 version next week.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective We began collaborating into Phase 2 of Project Eatgether. The team got together for a very efficient meeting in the morning to figure out tasks on hand (based off our previous User Story below) Italicized parts were completed last week, and bold parts are tasks which we completed today. Project Eatgether User Story用户可以通过填写邮箱，完成注册用户可以通过新建预约功能，提交预约信息 （log记录）用户可以通过“我约到的”功能，查看约饭对象用户可以通过取消预约（配对前）功能，取消未配对的预约（log记录）用户可以通过取消预约（配对后）功能，申请取消未配对的预约（邮件记录admin，邮件通知取消成功）用户可以通过详细预约功能，编辑详细的兴趣爱好用户可以通过确认越会功能，确认已约会（每个订单两个用户，admin手动确认见面，log记录）用户可以通过更新预约功能，在配对前更新信息用户可以通过删除记录功能，隐藏约饭信息 admin可以通过后台系统功能，查看所有邀约、订单、用户admin可以通过“连线”功能，配对预约（log记录，用户邮件提醒）admin可以通过查看所有配对信息功能，查看所有配对admin可以通过筛选连线状态功能，筛选未配对客户admin可以通过查看功能，查看用户详细信息admin可以通过删除功能，可删除预约（post），不能删除order，可以删除用户 We had an extremely productive day, during which most of the development goals were reached. Reflective I was assigned the task of creating “order status”. I used the ASM gem as we did before for the e-commerce project. Initially, we thought this was going to be very challenging, given that we have different status before “posts” and “orders”, but as I began coding I realized we really only need status for “orders”, because posts are all “unmatched” by default so creating a status for it would be redundant. The height of the day was realizing how quickly I can now build new actions through model, controller, view, and routes. I wrote up the user’s conditional order status view within 5 min while Han Han went for a cigarette. I got stuck on an issue with flash notices not being displayed for a while. Even YY couldn’t figure it out. I then noticed that in the admin page, the footer wasn’t showing up. So I checked the layout rendered for admin pages, and sure enough it was missing the &lt;%= render &quot;common/flashes&quot; %&gt; line. Interpretive I now realize how critical it is to build the development goals from User Story and outline development details as much as possible to avoid building features that are unimportant and time-consuming. I also learned more about how to collaborate with people and resolve merge conflicts. These are very helpful skills that will come handy later on. Decisional I need to learn more about the backend structure that Han Han and Zhang Shuo wrote, and we will need to spend a lot of time on HTML/CSS/JS together if we want this project to look good in the end.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[This week, we finished the Hackathon, tied for first-place, got treated to dinner by Xdite at China Grill (one of the top restaurants in Beijing), learned about the fastest way to create a Landing Page (quick 3-question survey + Unbounce template), entered a Landing Page contest (received positive feedback) and got a very good lecture on Growth Hacking. It had been a very productive week. The most useful thing I learned this week was definitely the logic behind creating a Landing Page, especially after hearing the lecture on Growth Hacking. I now recognize that a lot of the websites and apps we’ve seen before are now designed to their full potential due to lack of focus on the user. The lowest point of this week, unfortunately, was the result of the US election. It took me completely by surprise and I am still in shock as I follow post after post of friends in NYC/SF/LA/HK all being shocked and uncertain of the future. I am sorry that this really got to me, and I will work on letting these feelings go and focus on the tasks on hand this coming week. Now, some photos from the highlight of the week:]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective Today, I finished creating the landing page for Project Eatgether. The end product looks pretty sweet: I did the wording, layout, and Photoshopped the customized icons. Reflective During lunch, we spent an hour talking about our User Story (we did them independently), and figured out a way to merge all of our points together. We did it very efficiently and the team felt very accomplished. Design is detailed work, no matter if you’re writing CSS or using an online template to tweak it on Unbounced. I spent the day just grinding through the design bit by bit, spending most of the time looking for high quality photos that would fit into our product. Interpretive I have become better at making the Landing Page given that I now know how to locate good images and edit icons manually using Photoshop. Decisional We have now completed the basics of the project and are very much ready to move forward to the next phase.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today, the team discussed our project, and we decided to try something different from the “大V约饭” idea that was previously from the Landing Page contest. The reason being that dining with well-known people is already dominated by another company called 在行, and it didn’t seem that we were going to build anything different. Instead, we chose to do something related to online dating. Since people always want to meet new people but are either afraid of doing so out of rejection or too lazy to do so because no trustworthy platform exists. So we are going to pair people up, and only pair up those that are deemed trust worthy. We broke down the task into the “Must Have” / “Should Have” / “Could Have” and / “Nice to Have” categories, and assigned each team member with something that has to be done by end of this week. My task was to build a Landing Page, given my previous success with the landing page. I then built a survey with 3 questions and began sending them around to collect responses. My 3 questions are the following: 1. 当您使用社交软件确认约饭后，你最想要达成什么目标？ 2. 当你进入开始约饭的界面后，您最想要做什么事？ 3. 当您使用社交软件和想认识的人约饭时，最讨厌的事情是什么？ By the end of day, I received the below responses, and created a summary: Surprisingly, the biggest end-goal for people to have dinner on a “dinner arrangement” platform would be to have a nice dinner rather than “networking” or “getting laid”. Based on these new findings, we began crafting our Landing Page for tomorrow.]]></content>

My landing page was on an immigration business, and received very positive feedback from the class. I was very pleased.

      <url>%2F2016%2F11%2F09%2Fhow-can-trump-win-when-all-i-saw-were-hillary-supporters%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[On November 4th, 2008, students at Columbia University chanted their way up to Harlem following Obama’s victory, while supporters from Harlem rallied downtown. The two groups met in the middle of 120th St. and Broadway. People threw their arms open and hugged each other in ecstasy as the two crowds, a hodgepodge of different genders, races, ethnicities, and nationalities, merged into one – it was one of the most beautiful moments to be in New York City. 8 years later, as a Canadian-Chinese now living in Beijing, the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election seems to have very little to do with me. Yet I found myself practically glued to my phone all day, checking results by the minute. Somehow, this election seems different. This isn’t about weighing two near-equal options, or getting the first female president elected. This is about keeping the world balanced, or turning it upside-down. As the Chicago Tribune puts it, “Political campaigns are supposed to kick off debates about how we should feel about the candidates. Donald Trump’s campaign has started a debate about how we should feel about the candidate’s supporters, too.” At this very moment, my Facebook newsfeed is filled with “I can’t believe Trump is president” and “We are immigrating to Canada” type of posts. I eagerly put one up myself, about how the conservative sentiment from Brexit to Trump is spreading and the world will become more divided for years to come. Across the board from Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn, I don’t see a single post supporting Trump. The polls told a similar story up until the election. Across the NYT, Huffington Post, Princeton Election Consortium, and virtually every single poll, nearly everyone predicted a Democrat President. Yet here we are, President Trump-ed. Sure, I’m interested in finding out how Trump won, but I’m much more interested in finding out how we got it all wrong. And as I looked at the election result maps, the answer became more and more clear: Presidential Election Results by County Presidential Election Results – Change from 2012 In both maps, I have highlighted Manhattan – the only U.S. electoral “county” I have ever lived in, where 87.2% of voters voted Hillary. To prove my point further, I dug an old map of where my Facebook friends are geographically: Not clear enough? Let’s zoom in. This map looks remarkably similar to this map: Presidential Election Results by Size of Lead Call this the “echo chamber.” Unknowingly, I have been only looking at newsfeed by residents of Democrat’s biggest strongholds. And that is why I could never see Trump supporters. That is the big divide. Mainstream media face a similar problem. The Guardian calls it “The greatest American mystery at the moment”: _I call it a “mystery” because the working-class white people who make up the bulk of Trump’s fan base show up in amazing numbers for the candidate, filling stadiums and airport hangars, but their views, by and large, do not appear in our prestige newspapers. On their opinion pages, these publications take care to represent demographic categories of nearly every kind, but “blue-collar” is one they persistently overlook. The views of working-class people are so foreign to that universe that when New York Times columnist Nick Kristof wanted to “engage” a Trump supporter last week, he made one up, along with this imaginary person’s responses to his questions._By now, I know that most people whom this post will reach would probably share similar views with me. So like many of you, I had hoped that Hillary would win. I had hoped to see live on YouTube a rally on Broadway just like the one for Obama in 2008 and celebrate the first-ever female president. But that didn’t happen today. Not in places where we could see them anyway. A rally probably took place in Montgomery County, Texas, where Trump had a 74% victory over Hillary’s 22.5%. But we wouldn’t know. Few of us would ever meet many people from working-class Middle-America, never mind going there to understand what issues they face and how they think. In Trump’s victory speech, I found relief in the fact that he did not bring up the wall or say anything racist. But the most memorable line was probably this: “The forgotten men and women of our country, will be forgotten no longer.”To these men and women with whom most of us probably share no mutual friends, we owe them the respect they deserve, and honor the leader they have chosen. Regardless of what the future may look like, we will always fight to make it better, because that is what will always unite people, no matter how different their political stances may be. If we truly believe in “stronger together,” then that is what we should do.]]></content>

      <url>%2F2016%2F11%2F08%2F2016-11-08-day01-week-04-first-ever-hackathon%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[This past weekend, we completed our first-ever Hackathon. Our product - a mining game designed to use rubies as virtual currency to vote for questions that we’d like to ask the instructor. Since it’s a video game, we created the below theme to fit a “digging gems inside a cave” kind of scenario. We began working on the project starting Saturday, but we did not foresee the massive amount of work it would take to implement the backend logic as well as the frontend designs. On Sunday, I went home at 6am, but luckily the project was largely completed by then. The highlight was definitely being able to build a fantasy game styled theme. I had always wanted to build games when I was a kid, and finally having the chance and skills to do so is very rewarding. As our previous projects involved mostly Bootstrap and very little CSS work, this project challenged us to learn more about HTML/CSS. We added images to different behaviors (hover, active, etc.) and also sound effects for digging and finding treasure. One key learning from this Hackathon was team collaboration using Github. Our previous projects only involved forking from an original git and pull revised versions compared with the same original git. However, as now there are two people collaborating, and both working on the entire project at the same time, there will be conflicts when creating pull requests. Merging turned out to be rather complex when there are too many files that had been changed by both teammates. The low point of the project was at 5 in the morning, when I accidentally thought using “git rm” would remove the duplicate files and allow for merger to complete. I did this to about 10 files, after which I realized I couldn’t even get any page to open anymore. I began to freak out and frantically started Googling. I then found an incredible solution: 1git reset --hard master@&#123;&quot;20 minutes ago&quot;&#125; This command saved my life. The entire local git returned to its prestine state 20min ago and I was able to make edits manually on top of the origin file. This was more tedious of course, butit beats crashing the whole site. At the end of the presentations, our team came out tied for first place in the Hackathon. That was pretty awesome. We’re due for a fancy dinner with Xdite Wednesday at China Grill. Wasn’t expecting this when I signed up for the class so… pretty stoked!]]></content>

      <url>%2F2016%2F11%2F05%2F2016-11-05-day05-week03-launching-e-commerce-site%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective This week we further developed the e-commerce site with more core functionalities, including adding shopping cart, checkout order formation, order management, and deploying project onto Heroku. This is by far the most complex project compare to the previous projects. I now have 7 models, 8 controllers, a mailer, an uploader, and vendor CSS files. Reflective Some of the key learning this week came from being able to debug our code. I found gem pry to be an extremely helpful tool to accomplish this. By entering the error code line-by-line, I can pinpoint exactly which line contains the error, and by trying variations of the code in console, I can figure out exactly what works. Pry has been the most powerful tool I’ve found in this class so far. On the other hand, Heroku deployment is always a pain. I think I still need more practice with deploying onto Heroku in general, and getting used to the idea of development vs. production environment. I didn’t get Mail Gun to work because my account was suspended due to lack of business verification, and AWS also had problems with verifying my credit card address and my account was suspended. This is quite frustrating as using outside services means that there is no instant feedback and I’d have to wait for customer service to get back to me (probably after the weekend too). Interpretive I understand even better now why it is critical to leave out ample time for deployment because there’s a lot more moving pieces once you’re in the production phase of the project. I also have a better grip of how to add a post action, how to use various gems like aasm, roadie-rails, letter_opener, figaro, and fog. I also used a case... where statement to write how to display various action buttons, and making it look quite organized like this: I also began to summarize some key learnings into blog posts, some good ones from this week include: Managing AWS Key Using Figaro on Heroku for CarrierWave Using AASM Status to Manage Orders Building My Own Method Beyond CRUD Decisional I feel quite good about this week and the progress that’s been made on the e-commerce project. I do feel quite stuck on deployment and hope to learn more about how to deploy going forward, particularly with regards to using Chinese services and possible integration with Wechat.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[In order to store a large amount of information, websites need to purchase servers for space to do so. The server access information is needed for the servers to work. Such information must be maintained secretive, or the server can be stolen or compromised. There are a number of ways to accomplish this, but here we’ll talk about using gem figaro to secure server access information. First you need to make sure you’re already sign up for a server service somewhere, here we’ll use AWS (Amazon Web Services). Once you’ve signed up and verified your account, you can access the AWS console, where you’ll find “S3” under the “Storage &amp; Content Delivery” category. S3 is Amazon’s storage solution, typically used to store large binary files. Then, create a bucket. Name your bucket something relevant to your project and keep the name handy. Then, go to your text editor and do the following: Install gem figaro, run bundle install and then figaro install Run the following to create a copy of your application.yml file to be uploaded, but doesn’t contain your AWS access key info: 1cp config/application.yml config/application.yml.example Go to AWS console, under your user name on the top right, go to “Security Credentials”, then click on “Access Key (Acces Key ID and Seceret Access Key). Click “Create New Access Key” and download the file. Save it somewhere secure. Next go to application.yml and place your AWS access information, as an example: config/application.yml12345production: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX AWS_BUCKET_NAME: YOUR-BUCKET-NAME The above information is accessed by whatever gem in your app that is using the AWS storage. In my case, I’m using CarrierWave to upload images, but in order to connect to the AWS API I need another gem for integration called gem fog. So add gem fog to the Gemfile and run bundle install. And now in the imageuploader, disable the storage :file line. app/uploader/image_uploader.rb12class ImageUploader &lt; CarrierWave::Uploader::Base# storage :file Under config/initializers, create a carrierwave.rb file to help CarrierWave initialize, and add the below code: config/initializers/carrierwave.rb1234567891011121314CarrierWave.configure do |config| if Rails.env.production? config.storage :fog config.fog_credentials = &#123; provider: 'AWS', aws_access_key_id: ENV["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"], aws_secret_access_key: ENV["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"], region: 'eu-west-1' #(location of your S3 bucket) &#125; config.fog_directory = ENV["AWS_BUCKET_NAME"] else config.storage :file endend ENV is short for “Environment Variables”, and you can see these match the names in the application.yml file. Once these are set up, go to the .gitignore file and add in config/application.yml to make sure the git will not be uploading this file containing AWS access info onto Heroku. If this is done successfully, you should see config/application.yml either in light grey color or hidden away. Assuming you’ve already uploaded the current app onto Heroku, run figaro heroku:set -e production in Terminal, you should see the AWS information you’ve listed in application.yml listed. Run heroku config in Terminal, you should now see Heroku is setup with AWS configuration. If all above ran smoothly, you can now commit &amp; push to Heroku.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today we began introducing order status management using AASM gem. This allowed for order status to be managed more efficiently and effectively. In order to change order status, an event (keyword) must be invoked in the controller. The event is triggered by a post request from views. This completes the MVC loop. How to add a new :post action: Create post path in route and rake db:migrate Define post action in controller, linking another “action!” Create “action!” in model Create button in views, linking to path in route, remember to add :method =&gt; :post I also jot down some important notes and learning points that I found useful: How to change AASM state manually in terminal console: _[recommend first install gem awesome_rails_console to better view console results]_ See all orders by using Order.all Find the one you want by using Order.find(#) with # = the ID number Define a variable for this order AAA = Order.find(#) Check the AASM state of the order AAA.aasm_state Assign new AASM state (in this case we’ll use “paid”) AAA.aasm_state = &quot;paid&quot; Save AAA.save! (Must add “!” here to force save into the Order, otherwise only the variable AAA’s aasm state will be saved but not when you check again in Order) Important Distinction Between = vs. === When I tried to build an if… end statement using = to check value, it didn’t work. This is because = assigns value to a variable, not checking if there is an equality relationship. I changed this to === and it worked. This is a very juvenile mistake that I don’t think will happen again. Important Distinction Between Array and Single Variable When I tried to pull the admin user’s email address to send a notification email, the email pull could not work. In the console, I was told the “email” method was undefined. So I checked order.user vs. User.where(is_admin: true): Initially they looked the same to me. Then I noticed the [0] in front of the user details. I know that [ ] indicates an array, and 0 would be the position of the value in the array. So this is an array with just 1 value. Which meant that I had to specify which value in the array I wanted to call in order for the .email method to work. So I added .first at the end of the variable and pulled the email address successfully. How to correctly use Roadie Rails automatically I checked the gem roadie-rails website, for whatever reason they didn’t mention how to include the stylesheet inside the email template. app/views/order_mailer/notify_order_placed.html.erb1+ &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/application.scss" /&gt; This is a key step and without it the CSS would obviously not show up. For a more complete step-by-step simple installation, please see here. I have completed everything in the development stage at this point. The next step will be deployment onto Heroku, which will require an email client (MailGun), a password manager (figaro), and an image host, in addition to a number of issues that may come up along the way. I now understand why it is critical to leave out 1/3 of the time for deployment and user testing.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Observation Starting today I’m going to add a title to each blog post instead of the generic title of “DayXX WeekXX” so that I can tell from the title roughly what I’d be writing about. I also successfully built the mailer function and allowed it to be previewed locally using gem letter_openter. But because the homework instruction has asked that we “complete the formatting” for the emails, I have not submitted the mail function screenshots. I learned that emails cannot be formatted as easily because once it’s sent out it cannot read a separate .css file for formatting so all of the CSS need to be written inline. This would take forever given my lack of experience writing CSS, so I took some time figuring out how to use gems to help… but still working on it so more on that later when I have it all figured out. I built the admin/orders page to view all orders without referencing any previous homework instructions, but by referencing the previous job-listing and rails103 homeworks codes. Reflective The highlight today was when I logically figured out how to route admin/orders destroy action correctly between the Controller and Views. So up to this point, I would often copy/paste an CRUD action definition from another controller or a previous project, and test whether it would work for the current controller by trial-and-error. But this time I understood that because destroy method works on a single order, thus the order must be found, and the finding should be based on the token which was pre-generated when each order is created, so find_by_token(params[:id]) The low point today was when I tried to look up how to use gem roadie to figure out how email formatting works, it was not immediately clear to me how to do so. I found this website (https://cookieshq.co.uk/posts/how-to-style-emails-with-rails-and-roadie/) that seemed to have a very good instruction on how to build good-looking emails, but I couldn’t follow the instructions entirely. I couldn’t understand the following lines: 1234567893. Separate HTML (I&apos;ve put it into HAML for readability) from the CSS. Put the HAML file in your app/views/layouts folder and the CSS on your app/assets/stylesheets folder.4. Add email.css to the asset precompilation line on your application.rb.5. Tell your mailer, or some of your emails methods, to use the layout you just created. This is very easy and explained on the Rails Guides6. Get your layout to yield for the contents in your email views. As you will be working with tables, it could be a good a idea to have the main table in the layout, and the rows corresponding for the header and the footer in the layout as well. In the gist linked before, you can see an example, but it will vary depending on your template.7. Adapt your mailer views to work as (or within) a table. I will get some help on using gem roadie and see if I can get it working once I’ve completed the other development-oriented tasks. Interpretive One thing I realized is that working on beautifying an app can take a very long time. Bootstrap is great, but it has one theme, a very “bootstrapped” theme. So while its functions can be tested, it could never make the kind of visual impact I’d like without some level of customization, or better yet, an entirely new theme from a shrewd designer. Decisional Tomorrow I will work more efficiently and try to catch up with the tasks given. I think deployment will cause some headaches (with the mailer, key, and everything else that’s different from developmeent environment).]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective Today we were given clear instructions on how to build the order function (i.e. when a user decides to check out and make a purchase). I spent the morning finishing off the remaining 4 tasks left over from yesterday. Xdite explained that we were actually expected to finish all 6 yesterday, and that the instructions to add order function can be done separately from yesterday’s tasks. But I still felt compelled to finish in the order the assignments were given. Luckily, I figured out the 4 tasks pretty quickly (1. will not have duplicate items in cart 2. can change number of a certain item in cart 3. cannot purchase an item which has 0 quantity, 4. cannot add more quantity than what is in stock), though these functions can be improved (which I will get to when I have more time). Then I followed the instructions closely to build out the order function, which involved creating many migrations and establishing pretty complex relationships between models. Reflective In general I felt pretty good about myself as I completed one task after another, with occasional help from classmates to confirm if I’m on the right track (I’ve been going to the TA less frequently now). Interpretive Some key learning points today: “Member” vs. “Collection” - in routing, “member” sets a particular action routes for individual unit of a resource, while “collection” establishes the action for the whole resource. Redefining a variable - saying a + 1 doesn’t change the value of a, but a = a + 1 does. And when a variable’s value has been changed, it needs to be saved with .save method. Actions defined in the model can be called in the controller. Worth noting a lot of these concepts were realized from talking with classmates. Decisional One key hurdle that remains is figuring out how to call a particular method or data. For instance, what pre-defined method can be called in which of the MVC type of file? What is the difference between “CartItem”, “cart_item“, “cart_items“, “@cart_item“, and “@cart_items“? When to use “current_cart“ vs. “cart“ vs. “@cart“? I really hope to get a better hang of these over the course of this week.]]></content>

      <url>%2F2016%2F10%2F31%2F2016-10-31-day01-week03%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective Over the weekend I spent some time improving the visuals of the site. I came across a template for men’s fashion and decided to create a men’s fashion site as I had been shopping for a tuxedo prior to the program. Today we began Phase 2 of the e-commerce project. This phase involves creating a shopping cart and building all of the necessary functionalities around it. We were given hints on how to add a shopping cart upfront, but had to figure out on our own how to increase the shopping cart’s functionalities. I managed to complete Step 1: adding in the shopping cart, creating an index page of cart items, and has a total sum of all the cart items’ price. For the remaining 6 tasks, I only managed to complete 2 of them today: clearing shopping cart, and removing an individual item from shopping cart. Reflective During today’s assignment I had to do a lot more thinking rather than simply copy/pasting codes I had written for previous projects. I was stuck trying to create a remove_item_from_cart action by reverse-engineering the commands used to add_item_to_cart. After getting stuck on this for an hour or so, I decided to go ahead and create a controller for cart_items and used the destroy method to remove the cart item instead. In addition, when I added the shopping cart function, I encountered the database issue once again, with reported error: 1ActionView::Template::Error (SQLite3::SQLException: no such column: cart_items.cart_id: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM &quot;products&quot; INNER JOIN &quot;cart_items&quot; ON &quot;products&quot;.&quot;id&quot; = &quot;cart_items&quot;.&quot;product_id&quot; WHERE &quot;cart_items&quot;.&quot;cart_id&quot; = ?): After trying the rake db:migrate command multiple times to no avail, I followed the [database migration fix] (http://dyz2102-blog.logdown.com/posts/1042590) that I had written about earlier and resolved the issue. Interpretive Adding the shopping cart was the firt time that we are departing from the plain CRUD methods when creating a model. In building the clear_cart method, we did not use the destroy method, but rather a post action created in the model, by doing the following: Config route: config/routes.rb12345resources :carts do collection do post :clear_cart endend Define in controllerapp/controllers/application_controller.rb123456def clear_cart current_cart.cart_items.each do |item| item.destroy end redirect_to :backend (Careful not to place this under the “private” section otherwise it won’t be callable globally) Adding button in viewapp/views/carts/index.html.erb1&lt;%= link_to("Clear Cart", clear_cart_carts_path, method: :post, class: "btn btn-lg btn-primary pull-right") %&gt; The specific route for the already defined clear_cart action can be found using rake routes command: I realize now that there are actions beyond CRUD methods that we can define on our own as long as we get the logic right. Decisional In conversing with others in the class, I realize that though I can build certain functions by Googling and referencing prior projects, there were a lot of basic Ruby terminologies and logic that I am still unfamiliar with, which hinders my ability to discuss with classmates on coming up with solutions. I will need to spend more time on Ruby basics.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective This week we finished up the Job Listing projected and started on the new e-commerce project. I completed both projects without much difficulties (the key challenges have been outlined here and here). And today I began working on implementing Bootstrap templates to make the site better looking. Reflective The best parts of this week was probably being able to fork, build, pull, and complete a number of other tasks such as installing gems and running migrations on my own. I am getting a better hang of how Rails works, but definitely need to do a wider variety of projects to be exposed to more functionalities. The projects so far, a forum, a job listing site, and an e-commerce site, are all pretty similar, at least so far as we haven’t been building the shopping cart and generating payment/inventory management functions yet. At times I felt a bit bored, but I overcame that feeling by working on CSS to improve visuals of the site and learning the basics of coding from CodeAcademy. Interpretive One key realization this week was the distinction between bundling a gem file vs. downloading it form the developer website. If the gem is included in the Gemfile inside the repository, then every time it’s installed or updated, it will automatically fetch the latest version online (or whatever version you specify). This process is automated so that the developer would never have to worry about updating gems by checking developer websites individually. Another important realization is that creating visuals on websites is very detailed work. In the projects so far, because we haven’t been bothering with too much visual, this hasn’t come up as an important factor. But in practice, we of course want our projects to look nice, and working with CSS/JS can become a big part of development. Decisional With the above in mind, I will be spending more time learning how CSS/JS work in Rails. I really look forward to creating more functionality on the e-commerce website next week (shopping cart, checkout, inventory mangement, etc.).]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[I think the most useful concept I learned this week was the connection between Controller and View, specifically with regards to the index and show actions. With the index action, we are always dealing with all entries that have been made, so the variable is plural. For instance, we would declare under the product controller: products_controller.rb123def index @products = Product.allend In turn, when the index action is called, it renders the views/XXX/index.html.erb page. In this page, in order to retreive information for the products, we would have to call the @products variable: views/products/index.html.erb12&lt;% @products.each do |product| %&gt; &lt;%= image_tag (product.image.thumb.url) %&gt; Similarly, under the show action, we are dealing with information for a specific occurance of a product, and thus the word “product” should be singular. products_controller.rb123def show @product = Product.find(params[:id])end And in the views/products/show.html.erb file, we call the singular @product variable which has already been defined in the controller: views/products/show.html.erb1&lt;%= image_tag @product.image.medium.url, :class =&gt; "style_image" %&gt; This distinction really helped me to code better in the view files to make sure I’m getting the correct variables.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[The most challenging part of this year was getting the image uploader gem CarrierWave to work. I did these steps below: Installing the gem Loading the uploader in the model Adding a column using rails g migration AddImageToProduct Run rake db:migrate Adding the new column to the “product” controller … yet the upload still returned error! The error was that image was “nil”, which meant that the image didn’t get uploaded, or that in the product image wasn’t attached. So I checked the schema document and realized that even though I ran db:migrate, the image was never added to the schema - not sure why though. First, I tried to fix this with rake db:reset, which didn’t work because it takes the schema document rather than updating it. Then I used rake db:drop, rake db:create, and rake db:migrate to recreate the database, which finally worked. I wrote a more detailed version of the above issue here.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective Today I came into the classroom with 2 outstanding issues to resolve based on this week’s assignments: The first being fixing the routing such that products index and show can be accessed without the admin namespace, and the second being displaying the products index page as an image grid rather than a table. I finished both tasks largely on my own, with the only hint from the TA being “use Bootstrap code” for the second issue. Reflective It felt great to be able to resolve the above issues on my own. I am getting a better hang of the MVC framework, and can largely use rake routes to figure out the correct paths to direct links. I also finally understood the difference between namespace and resources. Interpretive I had previously worked on a e-commerce startup idea, and during the product sorting process my CTO told the team to only use square photos. After playing with CarrierWave and MiniMagick I now understand why. Square photos are easier to display as we can change dimension without having to worry about proportional ratios. I also understand now that some CSS codes are “hidden” inside the Bootstrap gem and can be called in the HTML directly (such as &lt;class=&quot;thumbnail&quot;&gt; would add a round-cornered border around an image or division. Decisional The tasks over the past two days have been fairly simple, and I have completed them without too much trouble, which means that I had learned sufficiently from the previous projects. However, as the e-commerce project grows in complexity (adding shopping cart, payment, inventory management, etc.) I very much expect and look forward to stretch my knowledge and brain next week.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective Today we began our second major project, which is to build an e-commerce website (I don’t want to say JD.com because honestly we’re not going to build anything remotely close to the level of complexity). Our tasks for this week (2.5 days including today) was to complete 5 steps: build up the backend, add in users, allow admin to modify backend, add admin user, and uploading photos. I was able to complete all of these tasks today - albeit with a few hiccups here and there - and will work on modifications of routing and visuals starting tomorrow. Reflective Initially we were told that the tasks were “five times” as challenging as what we had done on the Job Listing project. So a lot of us were quite freaked out and expected little assistance. But when we started, we realized there were actually a lot of hints in the slides that were posted. A lot of us didn’t realize there were gonna be slides and proceeded our own way until we got stuck. With the help of the slides, I managed to finish most of the tasks without much difficulties. I encounted a few issues that I had also encounted in the last project, and I wrote them down this time in this blog (see: - [Repeated Issue with DB Migration](http://dyz2102-blog.logdown.com/posts/1042590) - [Repeated Mistake on Bootstrap Dropdown Menu] (http://dyz2102-blog.logdown.com/posts/1040952)) Interpretive While most of the tasks today were repeats of what we had already done during the Intermediate Homework assignment and Job Listing project, some aspects were new, and these small differences helped me think through how to build the website differently from previous sites, and what these differences mean (i.e. how they would be reflected in the code). For instance, while resume was made into a model in the Job Listing project, image of items for sale in the e-commerce project don’t need to because they can just be added to the product model as an attachment. Decisional I think the key focus points of next-step learning are pretty clear: routing, migration, ruby syntax, and more HTML &amp; CSS as I begin to improve the visuals of the site.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[When trying to add attachment “image” to model “product” using gem CarrierWave, I used the following steps: Created a new column with rails g migration AddImageToProduct rake db:migrate Added :image in product_params in the private section of products_controller.rb However, I found out that even after repeated db:migrate / db:reset commands, I still could not get the uploader working. I then realized that in the schema.rb file that the “image” had not been added as a column, so the migration had failed. The fix was to run the following commands: 1234rake db:droprake db:createrake db:migraterake db:seed (The db:seedcommand is optional as I had manipulated the seed.rb file to create an admin account and normal account everytime the database is recreated.) This fixed the database issue and now the schema.rb file has the “image” column added, and I could upload images successfully. Apparently when running db:reset, even though the system drops and recreates the database, it takes the old schema document rather than re-running all the migration files to update the schema.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective Today involved a lot of Q&amp;A during which xdite helped answer a lot of areas which the class was confused about. Some important points for me included usage of private section of the controller, placement of gem under “development” section of the Gemfile, and other syntactic knowledge. I also began a tutorial under CodeAcademy’s Ruby on Rails. I also fixed an earlier bug on my Job Listing site where all the jobs/:id/resumes led to the same set of resumes (all resumes). This was accomplished by changing the index action from: 123def index @resumes = Resume.allend to:123def index @resumes = Job.find(params[:job_id]).resumes.order('created_at DESC')end Reflective Outside of researching for the additional homework and going through the QA section of the Github page, I also spent some time and configured VPN for my laptop/phone, and downloaded a bunch of Apps that I had only used back in college. I used Duotai’s configurations to set up Spotify, which was amazing and I could finally be freed from all the subpar playlists by Chinese providers like 网易云、虾米、QQ. Interpretive I learned more about the relationship between MVC and I found xdite’s #Rails 102# book very helpful in explaning some of the concepts that we’ve been using in the projects so far. I will spend more time and digest the book further. Decisional Today was more of a reflective day of the Job Listing project and revisiting some of the issues that different classmates have encountered. Tomorrow we will begin a new challenge to create something that is much more complex than the previous project. I’m pretty excited for the new challenge.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[“Partial Templates” (aka. “partials”) is a way for breaking down the rendering process into more simplified and manageable chunks. Think of it as a placeholder for a piece of the webpage that is stored in another file. The partial command calls for the other file to be rendered in the response. Calling a partial is coded as follows: 1&lt;%= render :partial =&gt; "menu" %&gt; This command would call for _menu.html.erb to be rendered where the above code is inserted. All partial view files are named with a leading underscore _XXX to distinguish partials from regular view files. During the Intermedia Homework assignment, the view/index.html.erb file used a partial to render the collection of the groups model, displaying information for each member of the group: index.html.erb12&lt;%= render :partial =&gt; "group_item", :collection =&gt; @groups, :as =&gt; :group %&gt; With the partial code: _group.item.html.erb12345678910111213&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;#&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= link_to(group.title, group_path(group)) %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= render_group_description(group) %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= group.user.email %&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;% if current_user &amp;&amp; current_user == group.user %&gt; &lt;%= link_to("Edit", edit_group_path(group), class: "btn btn-sm btn-default")%&gt; &lt;%= link_to("Delete", group_path(group), class: "btn btn-sm btn-default", method: :delete, data: &#123; confirm: "Are you sure?" &#125; )%&gt; &lt;% end %&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; This displays a table showing each group, which works similarly as the &lt;% @groups.each do |f| %&gt; function.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective Today we began “Phase 2” of the Job Listing Project, which involved Steps 6 through 8. Step 6 involved using the .order method and the “case…when…else…” statement to sort job listing by different metrics. This was fairly simple as the instructor has given sufficient hints in the slides. Step 7 involved using the Carrierwave gem to upload PDF-version resumes. Installing the gem and get the uploaded to work was the easy part, but establishing the relationship between Resume, Job, and User was challenging (details below). Step 8 involved adding the number of resume applied to a certain job posting to the admin view page, as well as making this number a live HTML link connecting to the resume index for view and download. This required good grasp of rake routes to ensure that I got the right paths set for links and was quite challenging as well. Reflective I got quite stuck during the part which needed to establish relationship between the three models, and even with the help of the TA it took me quite a while to realize what I missed. I need to better understand how to establish relationships between different models. Interpretive I learned two very important lessons today. One is that when building a form to enter information for a second-layer model, the code @MODEL isn’t sufficient, but needed to include [:MODEL1, @MODEL2]. For instance, in the second line below, resume is under job, and a form to upload resume would require square brackets around to establish a relationship with job: 123456789&lt;div class="well"&gt; &lt;%= form_for [:job, @resume], html: &#123; multipart: true &#125; do |f| %&gt; &lt;%= f.label :name %&gt; &lt;%= f.text_field :name %&gt; &lt;%= f.label :attachment %&gt; &lt;%= f.file_field :attachment %&gt; &lt;%= f.submit "Save", class: "btn btn-primary" %&gt; &lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Another important lessons I learned today is that in a three-model situation, when uploading a resume, we need to also set which job and user the resume belonged to. This is established by the following under the `resumes_controller.rb’: jobs_controller.rb123456789101112def create @job = Job.find(params[:job_id]) @resume = Resume.new(resume_params) @resume.job = @job @resume.user = current_user if @resume.save redirect_to job_path(@job), notice: "The resume #&#123;@resume.name&#125; has been uploaded." else render "new" end Essentially, if in the model there is a “belongs_to” relationship from one model to another, this needs also to be reflected in the controller. Decisional Today was overall productive as I was able to complete the assignment using Google (StackOverflow), the instructor’s PDF instructions, as well as the TA’s assistance. But I feel that I still lack understanding of the Ruby language and will begin to spend more time learning the fundamental aspects this week.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[During this week, my biggest challenge during the project was with Ruby’s syntax and understanding how the Rails database system worked.

Or I would misplace a gem in the inside of a “do…end” loop and end up having the gems not working properly. I think over the next week, I will spend some time on learning Ruby’s syntax to better familiarize myself with how these codes work. Rails Database When to use “rails g model XXX“ and how to establish relationships betwen various resources in the database is something I have yet to understand fully. I think only by doing more projects seeing more examples would I be able to get a better grasp of how these complex relationships worked in the Rails tree.]]></content>

I can at least now say I know how to start a project (rails new xxx), how to upload the project onto GitHub (git push XXX) so that it can be backedup and shared, and how to publish the project via Heroku (git push heroku) so that others can view it. I’ve also learned a lot about how to build a project with Ruby on Rails, starting from the MVC (Model, View, Controller) framework, to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy), and obtained a basic understanding of REST. Reflective During the beginnning of the week, I felt a bit concerned because I had only managed to complete the Intermedia Homework twice (instead of the requirement of 3 times minimum). But as I went along the tutorial for the Job Listing project, I realized I was able to build the project without too much difficulty. Of course, at times I needed the TA’s assistance, but even during those times I was able to learn something about how to shoot bugs. Interpretive I learned the rudimentary knowledge of Ruby on Rails, which required that I also learned some HTML and CSS. I am a big fan of fancy user interfaces and stylish page movements, so I really look forward to learning more and using more JavaScript codes. Decisional I felt that at times when I knew I was ahead of my classmates, I would just stop working and browse Facebook/Youtube (or finishing up the Intermediate Homework for the 3rd time because the progress bar keeps bothering me..). I think this is damaging to my learning experience. I will keep going with new tasks next week and push myself harder.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Objective Today, I finally had the chance to go through the HTML and CSS tutorials on the W3School website. Having seen these codes so much in the projects thus far, I found it very helpful to understand the meaning and syntax behind these codes. With regards to the Job Listing project, I set up the seed.rb file such that when I reset my database, I would not have to recreate admin and new job listings every single time. Reflective The highlight of the day was when I got the seed.rb file working and saw the machine magically creating 10 public jobs, 10 hidden jobs, and an admin account. The worst part was finding the HTML and CSS tutorials quite boring, almost putting me to sleep. Interpretive At this point I understand the relevance and importance of understanding these codes; however, it was still boring to just read - it is much more interesting to do. Decisional Tomorrow I will begin next week’s assignment of setting up user group for job applicants and allowing this user group to upload files.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[During today’s practice I completed Step 5 of the Week 1 Assignments, which included making is_hidden a button, using a new gem called Font Awesome, adding a sidebar, and preventing users from manipulating the URL to access certain job entries. Surprisingly, I completed the Font Awesome icon task first, by finding installation instructions on the Font Awesome website, I was able to follow the instruction and replacing texts in the if/then statement with Font Awesome icons. I took a bit longer to solve the job#show URL prevention, but figured it out after trying out a bunch of codes from Stack Overflow. When I figured out the 2 tasks above completely on my own, those were the highlights of my day. For sidebar and is_hidden button creation, I struggled and had to seek the TA’s help. I was told there were a number of codes that we had not yet learned from the homework, and the TA sent me some codes to use for the sidebar and I referenced Xdite’s codes for the is_hidden button. I learned the difference between .rb and .html.erb file types today, after trying to paste HTML codes into .rb files which failed. I saw some JavaScript codes available online when creating a fance sidebar (using CSS/HTML/JS together), and I look forward to trying that out in the days to come.I realize now that all these codes are working in conjunction to create the same website - they are not mutually exclusive when it comes to working on a single project. I would say my mindset around solving coding issues have improved, as I now realize there is no “standard” answer in coding - there are always many different ways of achieving an effect, and it’s up to the developer to pick which method is most suitable. And what’s interesting in the coding world is that when developers find a better solution, they would often go back and replace the old solution with the new solution. This is very different from my previous profession in investment banking, where projects that are completed are often left intact because there is little possibility of going back to review what’s been done in the past.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Today I completed all 4 steps of the assignment. I created a job-posting website using Rails, generated CRUD functions for job postings, and created users/admins with different levels of control. When we first started, I was not sure where to start, so I naturally began by following the Medium Level Homework Assignment, replacing “group” with “job”. This worked fine for Step 1. However, by Step 2, the User Story of the job-posting site required different logic from the Discussion Forum in the homework, and I had trouble figuring out how this should work. With the help of TA, I was able to figure this out slowly by following the answer key. Step 3 and 4 were like solving a puzzle. Once I got a better understanding of when to use “rails g” and “db:migrate”, I quickly solved step 3 and moved onto step 4, which was not in any of our previous homeworks and had little hint to draw from. I Googled online for usage of boolean, and decided that the checkbox was easiest to use in this case. Over the span of about 3 hours and with some assistance from the TA, I solved step 4 - best moment of my day. I learned that creating a new column value requires using “rails g” and “db:migrate”, and that one cannot edit the “schema” document manually. I got a better understanding of where to look forwhat document to edit, particularly the controller.rb and views/XXX/XXX.html.erb files. Today’s work was challenging, but solvable. There were a few places where, without the help of the TA, there is no way I could have figured it out (such as changing “simple_form_for @job” to “simple_form_for [:admin, @job]”). But otherwise, I believe today’s exercises were challenging but rewarding.]]></content>

We are told that though we have the best teachers and learning materials, we will still be required to put in lots of efforts. We were given a group assignment to come up with the task list of building a basic online recruiting website, and the team went in deep discussions about priorities in terms of “must have”, “should have”, “could have”, and “nice to have” levels. As I have previously run a startup in the online recruitment space, I was able to contribute actively to the discussion. I learned about basic project brainstorming process and how to come up with tasks. I have also completed the assignment, learning how “forking” and “pull requests” work.

I have managed to remember basic commands such as “rails s”, “git add .”, “git commit -m”, “rake db:migrate” etc. I had trouble with Gem installations, particularly on handling “sqlite3” (I placed it between a do/end command which caused problems). When everything flows and works, I felt great. I learned to find files faster by remembering the first couple letters in the file locations. I learned that Gem installation is an important and tricky part of programming. I will be more careful and follow instructions more closely going forward. — Update — Quick suggestion: In this instruction, the last line “+end” is unnecessary, because the existing code already has an “end” for the previous “do” command, so adding “end” here would create 4 “end” commands while there are only 3 “do” commands.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[This is my first-ever blog post as a programming student. When I graduated from college 4 years ago, I never thought I’d go back to school again. I don’t dislike learning, I just think school does a terrible job simulating to the outside world. While in school, we tend to receive far more encouragements than criticisms; we tend to be placed in leadership positions based on age, seniority, or simply, lack of competition. But the outside world is very different. One begins as an entry-level employee at a very large firm, typically even bigger than most universities, faces many obligations (the heaviest of which is the financial obligation of obtaining the material possessions which we desire, the most burdensome of which include a mortgage and a car). At that point, it is too easy for one to be caught up in the midst of “life” rather than to focus on any sort of dream or larger, wildly unthinkable goals. I wanted to avoid that trap. I wanted to avoid taking paths that many have taken only to find out that it doesn’t lead to where I want to be. I want to be a valuable asset to the world, not just a wealthy individual with material possessions that are only valuable because other people believe so. This is why I’m signed up for this class. To learn. To try. To create.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[When my colleagues first found out that I was leaving banking for private equity, they congratulated me. After all, moving to the “buy-side” after 2 years of banking was something to be proud of. But when they found out I was leaving Hong Kong for Beijing, their jaws dropped. What??? Are you forreal? The air there is toxic, the food is poisonous, the traffic is suffocating, and the tax is demoralizing. What is wrong with you? Do you hate Hong Kong or something? No, the truth is, I love Hong Kong. The two years I have spent in Hong Kong are probably the most carefree and purposeless fun I will ever have in my entire life. But I had to go – because something was missing in Hong Kong. 67/F Cheung Kong Center, where I have spent longer hours starring at a computer screen than my entire pre-work life combined. No, I’m not talking about the work experience of pumping out models and PowerPoint slides like a machine around the clock, or the deal experience of closing cross-border M&amp;A’s to earn bragging rights among fellow bankers, or the travel experience of flying business class with corporate executives from New York and London. I’m talking about living the Hong Kong-style life, under the neon lights of Lan Kwai Fong, about the materialistic life that makes living and breathing the Hong Kong experience a young bachelor’s must-have in a lifetime. When I boarded flight Delta 173 on August 17th, 2012 from JFK to HKG, the city with the highest concentration of Rolls Royce’s and the most tall buildings in the world, I knew it was time to lay off the gas pedal and just enjoy the ride. Grand opening party of a new club in LKF, the name of which I can no longer recall. The club closed within a year. As affluent Hong Kongers are some of the world’s best practitioners of hedonism, you will find yourself quickly blending in the Hong Kong lifestyle around happy hours, dinners, boat trips, birthday parties and other forms of wine &amp; dine experiences. You go from ordinary food establishments like Tsui Wah and SimplyLife to private kitchens and Michelin stars; you start to turn down tourist bars along LKF hill in favor of whiskey bars, cigar bars, sheesha bars, ice bars, dining-in-the-dark restaurant &amp; bars, liquid nitrogen ice cream bars, your friend’s bars, your friend’s friend’s bars, and so on. If you can think of it, it’s there in HK. You find dining &amp; entertainment expenses escalating over your rent in almost no time (particularly if you are male, the gender which always pays). Slowly, your spare capacity goes from planning your life as a great [insert dream here] to planning your next fancy dinner, your next epic weekend, your next marvelous holiday, your next fabulous birthday party… and the list goes on. Probably the best city view in the world. Gradually, the comfort and safety of Hong Kong bring you what you’ve always desired – the pure enjoyment of life itself, without having to feel sorry about it because everyone around you is doing the exact same. You don’t see the negativities of society anymore around you. Poverty doesn’t show its faces, crime doesn’t come near you, pollution isn’t broadcasted as a social problem, food safety is almost guaranteed, healthcare services are among the best in the world, and tax is definitely not getting any complaints – if utopia existed, it would look something like Hong Kong Central. But once you’ve spent long enough time here, you will see that Hong Kong is a concrete jungle not only for its buildings and underground tunnels, but also for zero social mobility. The resulting social structure under these circumstances is not one where everyone is talking about the global power dynamics, debating the benefits and harms of creative destruction, pondering the philosophical nature of the human existence, or even whispering the future of democracy. No. That is not Hong Kong. At least not the Hong Kong I have experienced. Living in Hong Kong as an expat is much more like attending the grand parties of the Great Gatsby__, where the crème of the crop of the Ivy League and Oxbridge graduates proudly settle in the most fit-and-proper professions ranging from doctors, lawyers, accountants, to bankers and civil servants, toasting and celebrating the greatness of their own achievements. Magnum, where film “Lan Kwai Fong” was filmed. Magnum Entertainment listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in January 2014. The offering was over 3000 times oversubscribed. Currently shares trade 50% below its first week’s performance. But the most mercenary aspect of Hong Kong is the ease of leaving her. During SARS, those who could leave disserted the city and made it a ghost town almost overnight. In the 1990’s (think 89 and 97), those who could afford to emigration in Hong Kong have all obtained foreign passports, with Vancouver being one of the favorite destinations – and the reason behind my conversational Cantonese having grown up there. Hong Kong, in this sad existence, is Mr. Gatsby himself. If he dies, no one will be staying for the funeral, because his guests are busy and have got other parties to catch. Admittedly, for the better part of my 2 years in Hong Kong, I was one of them. I lived my life as a guest in Mr. Gatzby’s party, and I gave my love to every moment I have spent inside his doors. I have been there, standing in the VIP areas of Dragon-I/Volar/Levels/Magnum, on the floor, on the table, on the stage, feeling like I’m with the most important people in the entire world. I have been there, dropping my entire month’s salary hosting parties and treating friends ranging from my future best man to someone I have never even met and will never meet again. I have been there, posting photos of drinking and partying festivities on Facebook to gain popularity and social status, making acquaintances so numerous that deleting them all would probably be faster if I got a new phone and reinstalled Whatsapp. Don’t get me wrong. There are plenty of very successful people in Hong Kong who have found the right balance to achieve happiness across the spectrum of one’s life desires. But your 20’s is meant to be spent in a way to maximize your potentials, and the 24/7 work-party-sleep cycle isn’t exactly “maximizing” - it’s in fact “burning”, eating away the fuel and the drive to reach the dreams you once had. After an all-nighter at the printer for a company’s IPO. Long hours typically result in a binary lifestyle swinging between extreme work and extreme play. So as one of the most junior attendees of Mr. Gatsby’s great parties, I have chosen to walk away. After all, what is the point of devoting my most productive years to a grand party, only to be handed another glass of champagne, gazing upward to tycoons who will always be tycoons, and dancing alongside white-collars who will always be white-collars. Leaving Hong Kong was not because it was destroying my body or polluting my mind, but because it was killing who I could be.

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Some say I have abandoned this blog. I have not. I constantly think about what I want to post here, share here, and have started many drafts that were never complete. It takes a big chunk of time to generate the focus that will result in a good post, and as I have come to learn, while it is possible for a banking analyst to make time to balance out work and play, allocating that additional few precious hours to sit in front of a computer to write is much harder when you’ve already sat in front of a computer for the most part of a 24-hr day. So here we are, capitalizing on the Chinese New Year break, blackberry-free and too lazy to move after consecutive nights of festivities having consumed as much food and liquor as my body could handle without getting sick, I am ready to share the snapshot of my 2012. Leaving Columbia and NYC 2012 was an important year for me. Originally the class of 2011, I took a gap year and moved my seat to the class of 2012. Many people asked me what it was like to be back in school again. It felt like home. Like how you leave home for a year to school and return for the first time in 12 months. And like returning home after a long year abroad, I became more appreciative of what being in school had to offer and came to appreciate my alma mater. Learning was more fun (but only on a relative basis compare to previous semesters), because I finally had some real life experiences to convince myself the things I was learning were relevant. While the typical senior year results in borderline F’s and increased risk of alcoholism, I did better than any previous semester and forged new friendships based more so on common interests rather than social cliques. But however nice school was, my mind had already felt like I was a graduate. Home, metaphorically or actually, was never a place where I dwelled extensively. Exactly a year ago, I finished my degree and came back to China to take part in starting a local VC/PE shop in China, in search of the kind of experience that I knew I’d never get once I set foot on the sacred pilgrimage of bulge bracket investment banking. In May, I returned to NYC for the graduation ceremony. In June, I returned to NYC one more time for the global IBD training. When I boarded Delta 173 at JFK on August 17th, 2012, I knew I had ran out of degrees of freedom to go back to the greatest city in the world. Asia - the Here and Now During my college years, most of the ambitious college students with Chinese heritage have a China dream of sorts. Some chose to put those dreams to action right away, while others chose to gain more experiences abroad before returning. Having left China at the age of 10, and having engaged with a serious group of like-minded individuals through GCC, I simply did not have the patience to be part of the second group. Hong Kong is a unique place. It’s filled with more exclusive clubs and associations than any other city I’ve lived in, and the whole city itself seems to be built on the elements of capitalism: consumerism, materialism, elitism, pragmatism - doesn’t sound like the most friendly place to live in the world, but there is upside. The combination of early exposure to capitalism, a small geographic area, dense population, and the Hong Kong people’s desire for achievements and global recognition has created one of the most efficient cities ever built by mankind. The most advanced mobile technology, transportation systems, public infrastructure, low-cost of domestic helpers and the simple close-proximity of everything spoil the expats here to consider almost every other city in the world, inconvenient. And I have, for better or worse, become one of them. As one can imagine, not everyone likes it this way. I am not short of friends who have shied away from Hong Kong because of its culture and the difficulties involved in adjusting to this city because of the challenge of Cantonese, the jaw-dropping rent (usually followed by varying degrees of claustrophobia) or a combination of all of the above. Luckily, having learned to appreciate Cantonese culture since TVB was available in China in the 90’s, and growing up in the beautiful Hong-couver, I saw no challenge in the language or culture. Though I’ve always been interested in Hong Kong, the firmness of my decision to work in Hong Kong was purely a result of my gap year. I saw first-hand the types of opportunities that were available to young graduates in PRC, where the training of new grads never seems to make it to the top of CEOs’ agenda, I knew it was better to start in a more cosmopolitan environment with 1. English as the main working language and 2. a high degree of efficiency from mobile services to elevators to public transportations and 3. access to a great diversity of people. And Hong Kong has all three - always has, always will. When I landed in HKG at 11pm on Aug 18th, 2012, I was on familiar ground. Everyone of us desired our China dream. And here’s mine.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Do you ever feel like you live two separate lives?每次跨越太平洋的时候，都会有同样的感受。但随后它却又悄悄地、缓慢地消失⋯⋯直至完全被大脑抛弃，删除。这可能更加证实了人类是非常健忘地动物，完全活在现在，过分地以视觉、听觉及其他感官所带来的刺激因素，而淡化，甚至忘却，另一个地方的另外一个自己。从进化论的角度来看，或许这也是为了生存。人类把99%的注意力都集中在当下，因为当下的生存能力决定了未来。而任何的过去，都是留给在当下过分清闲的人用来解闷的图书馆、音乐厅、电影院。而每次横跨太平洋，却是见证两个世界共同存在的最好时机。比如，从纽约JFK机场塔上国航的航班，就好像半只脚已经踏入了国门，人、语言、空气、乘务员的服装、颜色、地毯和椅子散发出来的气味，一一触碰着脑海里的记忆神经，而随着飞机起飞后的腾空，地理位置的移动也开始提醒自己：马上就要迎接新的环境，哦不，是旧的环境⋯⋯就像打开一个个新的程序一样，此刻脑海里的语言、应变能力、警惕心理又从记忆硬盘当中调了出来。同样的，当在北京机场踏上美联航的航班时，空中服务人员对人平等的态度、机箱里更加宽敞的椅子、每个乘务员标准的英语、甚至是发给乘客的pretzels，都提醒着我：马上要迎接的是一个人人都有主见的自由社会，而在这种社会里唯一的生存方法，就是拥有自信、头脑、幽默感、以及比他人更加难以动摇的主见。有时后，觉得自己象是一台装了Windows的Mac，虽然小时候一直是用Windows，但自十岁起开始转用Mac OS，也逐渐成为了忠实的苹果粉丝。此时再回到Windows，还是会用，每次都需要一段时间熟悉，慢慢也会习惯，只是偶尔还是会对Mac存有浅浅的怀念，因为用惯了更好的系统，当然回不去了。作为纽约的普通人，每天可以乘着百年老的地铁，走着路，吃着地边摊，住着比爷爷还老的房子，过着很悠闲、很轻松、很快乐的日子。但如果要做一个普通的北京人，做同样的事情呢？地铁？去哪儿都只能走路？吃路边摊？住比爷爷还老的房子？随着越来越多的人都拥有属于自己的两个，甚至是更多，不同的世界，如何生活和如何去选择一种生活可能会是越来越让我们痛苦的决定。In this case, options aren’t simply always good.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[2012年6月3日下午8：57分 台中往台北高铁 为了参加Renet的活动，有生以来第一次来到台湾，乘坐着台中往台北的高铁，静静思考着过去几天对台湾的印象。第一次来台湾，也只是待了短短的5天，所以只能仅凭一点主观的观察描述一下微观的社会。听着周杰伦的《青花瓷》，深深感受到海峡的另一端生活的人，是如何在多个方面保持着比我眼中的中国更中国的传统和美德。 刚到台北，从机场出来后第一个跟我聊天的是机场出租车的司机。他的礼貌、谈吐，都让我对台湾的印象足以打满分。当然，台北市政府对于机场接机出租车的管理也是出奇的严格。所有的车必须是最多开过2年的新车，因为新车安全性较好，而如果受到客户投诉的话会自动停牌2-7天，投诉3次送往行检局，入行检局2次就会被彻底开除。 在台中等列车时，轻轻的风，蓝蓝的天，但可能最让我难忘的，是台中高铁站月台的静。静到可以听到鸟叫，听到风从耳边穿过，听到那么几个行人的脚步声。的确，台湾人不喜欢大吵大闹，这一点从故宫博物馆里穿梭于游客之中的高举着“禁止大声喧哗”手牌的工作人员的表情里就可以看得出来。台北的捷运上更是静得出奇，仿佛如果开口说话就是在打扰别人，打破每一个公共场合应有的，几乎神圣的peacefulness。 站在台中高铁站的月台，有种回到家的感觉。 台湾的服务人员，无论是企业的还是政府的，都给我留下了礼貌到极致的印象。有时，“谢谢”的回答不是“不客气”而是另一句“谢谢”。我感谢你帮助了我，而你感谢我让你有了帮助我的机会。再高尚的美德不过如此简单。中国的每一种权利都在过去的30年中被金钱化，而在台湾，权利是一种荣誉，是选民给予每一个政客的机会，而滥用这个机会的人即会得到应有的惩罚。陈水扁的案例再清楚不过。 在心理学中，能够区分后天环境和先天基因对人类影响的就是研究一对双胞胎。因为他们的基因一样，所以他们长大后的所有差异都来自于外界对他们的影响。同样的，如果要研究中华民族到底能否做的更好，怎样做得更好，台湾和大陆得对比可以说类同于心理学上对一对双胞胎的研究。 人对人和蔼可亲的态度，对他人的基本尊重以及对自己的基本要求，都让我感到很惊讶 - 海峡两岸的两个孪生兄弟，怎么在100年间差距可以拉的这么远。 是，台北比我想像当中要破很多，它的楼房大多都很旧，而且高楼大厦要远远少于香港、上海、北京，甚至连武汉的高楼都要多过台北。但一个国家治理的好与坏不是靠它楼宇的高低密度而决定，一个民族的幸福也不是靠它的GDP增长率来衡量。的确，台湾的经济不如从前，越来越多的“世界第一”和“亚洲第一”逐渐被大陆和其他的竞争对手所取代，公民的团结意识也消磨在缺乏主导思想的民主政治的诋毁和谩骂声中。但一个国家的未来为什么要和多个“世界第一”密切相关？国际关系并不是一场谁拿第一的游戏，尽管大部分人在投票的时候难免受到某种盲目的爱国主义的干扰。 幸福与否，大多数取决于信仰、信念，而非物质。一个永远不会满足的民族，自然永远不会幸福；一个得到足够就很满足的民族，自然很容易就会幸福。 所以我眼中的台湾人，很礼貌，很幸福。]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[A while back, a friend of mine posted an article from the Esquire on his Facebook titled “The War Against Youth“ (in America). I got interested and had a few thoughts on the same problem in a Chinese context. [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”460”] Graphic from Esquire.com[/caption] The article argued that “[n]obody ever talks about generational conflicts,” because it’s difficult to bring up. I disagree. Americans are too liberal and too vocal to shy away from bringing up anything that they think is worth arguing for. The fundamental problem of the lack of discussion in inter-generational conflicts is that people of different generations tend to think of each other as in-group members as opposed to out-group members. For instance, I would place my father within my “group” rather than an opposing group when considering things like “class conflicts.” We are much more likely to group together and fight for common interests based on race, ethnicity, nationality, and geographic regions than by age or generations. But inter-generational conflict exists. Because in general, the older you get, the more you make and the less you have to work for it. The fact that you make more as you get older is pretty intuitive, because you build up experiences and expertise through years of work. But the proportion at which this gap exists should also make sense. Not in the US. “In 1984, American breadwinners who were 65 and over made 10 times as much as those under 35. The year Obama took office, older Americans made almost 47 times as much as the younger generation…” A jump from 10x to 47x in the span of 24 years. How did that happen? Did older people contribute more and more during this time? Or did experience become more and more valuable? If asked which one is more important for the nation, I think most people would agree that education is of a higher priority than Medicare. But money says otherwise. “The federal government spends $480 billion on Medicare and $68 billion on education… Across the board, the money flows not to helping the young grow up, but helping the old die comfortably.” According to a 2009 Brookings Institution study, “The United States spends 2.4 times as much on the elderly as on children, measured on a per capita basis, with the ratio rising to 7 to 1 if looking just at the federal budget.” This may be caused partly by the fact that 1. it costs more to keep people alive than to put kids through school and 2. the US population is aging as baby-boomers retire. Now let’s take a look at the lives of the young Chinese graduating from college. For their entire lives, grades have been the only thing that mattered to get to the top. The most successful students of China are the best at memorization and test-taking. Yet what lies ahead after graduation is one of the most complex and political worlds imaginable. Their skill-sets, mastery of test-taking and problem-solving, are of little to no help. But this is only one of many difficulties lying ahead for them. From education to on-the-job training, from the job markets to culture, nothing helps the Chinese youth - except maybe their parents who can and are willing to. Education - The Chinese education system is widely acknowledged to inhibit students from developing a creative mind and face real world problems. The One-Child Policy only exacerbated the problem by allowing grandparents to treat their only grandson or granddaughter as their “bao bei” (“precious”) and not allowing them to encounter any type of hardship from childhood through adulthood. Many children from affluent families end up finding jobs through family connections, and those from low-income families with no solid connections often take up low-wage entry-level jobs in manufacturing or services. Still, with all the funding poured into education, “[a] McKinsey study found that 44 percent of executives in Chinese companies reported that insufficient talent limited their global ambitions.” To make matter worse, “According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the average college graduate earns just 300 yuan – roughly $45 – more than average migrant worker [per month],” which explains why so many rural students choose to drop out of school and begin work early rather finishing their zero-value education. On-the-Job Training - Having experience working in Beijing, Hong Kong, and New York, I can speak to this from my personal experience - on-the-job training in China is pretty bad. How bad it is will really depend on what type of company you work for. But the point is not just a general lack of formal training programs, but also a lack of mentorship and professional developmental networks. How much people are willing to help you really depends on what you have to offer in return. This makes it very difficult for ordinary young professionals to move up because all they have to offer initially is pure physical labor. Without quickly assemble resources and figure out how to utilize everything around you, you may find yourself stuck at the bottom of the food-chain with no end in sight. Job Market - State-owned enterprises dominate the job market; jobs at state-owned monopolies in fields like oil &amp; gas, telecom, and financial services are among the most coveted careers in China. But they are nothing like corporations and private enterprises. In SOEs it is generally understood that the longer you stay, the more power you have and the more income you generate. But doing the most work doesn’t necessarily make you last the longest; staying out of trouble does. Therefore, there is little that a young person can do in an SOE other than to wait, and the incentives against innovation create some of the world’s largest “dinosaur companies.” Below is how an SOE entry-level employee described her situation online: “工作，我们俩都是在国企，都是那种稳定到死的，在各自家里看来，如果要辞职就是脑子有病。在工作初期家里都是花了银子托了关系的，家里完全不赞同辞职。而且是双方家里都是这情况！ 但说实话，我们俩对自己的工作都不是很满意，没什么前途，就是熬日子，国企基本都这样。” “In terms of jobs, my boyfriend and I both work at SOEs, the most stable type possible. In the view of both of our families, we’d be retarded to quit and try something else. In order to get these jobs our families both had to pay people money and find connections, which is why they don’t agree when we told them we wanted to quit. What makes it worse is that my boyfriend and I are in the exact same situation! Honestly speaking, we are both not satisfied with our jobs, there’s no future. The only thing to do is sit there and get by the days - SOEs are basically all the same.” Today, even lesser-known SOEs require some guanxi to get in, and the better-known ones (usually monopolies) may cost you both guanxi as well as money, as is the case above. A job at CCTV may costs you a few thousand US dollars; a job as a stewardess for Air China may be double that. That is if you already have the necessary qualifications for these positions. This shows that people would rather wait for years for higher-level income than taking any risks in the more competitive non-SOE markets. Below, we can see that as of 2010, seven out of fifteen of the world’s largest employers are Chinese SOE’s. This is not counting the 2.3 million peopled hired by the PLA. [caption id=”attachment_531” align=”aligncenter” width=”399”] CNNMoney’s ranking of world’s largest employers[/caption] Cultural Reality - In my earlier post, I talked about how “[i]n the West, youth is good. Youth is energy, opportunities, and possibilities. But in China, youth is immaturity. It equates to inexperience, which to most people screams unreliability (i.e. 不靠谱).” But you can’t blame people for believing this. Younger professionals often quit without notifying his/her boss, steal corporate contacts and other confidential information, or just have a lack of commitment in general. This creates a vicious cycle when society doesn’t help young people which forces them to break more rules and make them seem even more unreliable. The gerontocratic nature of China’s government and SOE systems is largely a matter of political legacy, and a common legacy of most states with a powerful central government. All of China’s presidents took power at age 60+, with some remaining in power until death. In comparison, Obama took office when he was 48, and no one really cares where Bush or Clinton is. The older generation of Chinese are sitting on anywhere between 10-30 years of savings, and many receive retirement compensations at a rate of RMB1000+/month (equivalent of minimum wage at a small second-tier city in China) and enjoyed a huge boost from the housing boom if they owned any property from 2005-2009. But keep in mind that elderly people are generally married (income x2), have no mortgage (housing often taken care of by the SOEs from the communist era), lower spending habits, and money from their children, with medical care as their highest area of spending. The younger Chinese on the other hand, must pay for mortgage in post-housing-boom China (if they want to get married and move out), spend more on social and leisure activities, take care of the children’s education (a rising cost), and sometimes take care of the elderly parents. While it’s true that when older generations pass away, they often pass down all their assets to their children (a source of conflicts in many Chinese families between siblings), but with inflation at 5-6% per annum (and far more so at the most metropolitan areas), the middle-aged Chinese are feeling squeezed, and the younger Chinese graduating from college simply see no light at the end of the tunnel. Unlike in the US, where college grads are pretty much on their own, Chinese parents are often willing to take care of their children for as long as they can. This makes some people’s lives easier, but it creates another huge problem - the inequality of opportunities. A research paper from 2010 found that, in China, “richer parents helped a person’s prospects (a 10% increment in parental income was reflected in a 4.5% income boost for their offspring) and having parents who were employed by the state helped a lot. Parental education, on the other hand, was no help whatsoever. In these provinces, where your parent works matters more than where he went to school” (italics added). How to End this War A few bright spots that might materially shift the dynamics in this “War Against Youth” may be the privatization of state monopolies, the growing service industry, and the IT industry. Baidu, for example, employs over 16,000 people and with an average age of 26. There are also countless number of jobs created via various start-ups in e-commerce, social media, and other forms of online innovation. China’s current leaders may still be under the influences from China’s turbulent past, but a commitment toward a more open society, starting from the top, may usher in a new era of explosive development through deregulation and innovation. At least that is what we hope for. If the above sound all too serious, here’s some comedy relief. Watch this episode of Family Guy, where Chris and Meg Griffin traded place with Peter and Lois, only to realize that it’s not easy to be kids or parents, and enjoy a good laugh!]]></content>

      <url>%2F2012%2F04%2F19%2Fmy-thoughts-on-the-world-journal-e3-80-8a-e4-b8-96-e7-95-8c-e6-97-a5-e6-8a-a5-e3-80-8b-article-on-gap-year%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Last Fall, I received a phone call from a journalist from the World Journal who’d like to learn more about my decision to take a gap year and what I did with it. A few months later, an article appeared in the print-version of the World Journal magazine with a story covering gap years and how more and more students are taking them. Many people have told me how much they wish they had taken a gap year while in college. After speaking with many Chinese people over the past few months, I am starting to believe that Chinese students would benefit even more from taking gap years than American students. The real - and really, the most important - goal of a gap year is to self-actualize - to understand the self, to find meaning behind the things we do, and to figure out where we are headed to. While many American students have clear goals in mind, they are not always certain as to why they are going after those goals or what those goals will bring to them. But the way with Chinese students is that very few of them have their own goals to begin with - their parents set their goals. Many Chinese students are simply living a planned life masterminded by their parents. “I live much longer than you and that is why I know better” is the common mentality between most Chinese parents, instilling in their children both pragmatism and obedience. Students are often muted because they cannot voice an opinion strong and convincing enough that their parents realize that they must back off. A gap year allows an opportunity to develop that opinion. I really believe that I have figured out a way to make a gap year _strategically beneficial _in every way possible. Although the article below cites many students who take gap years between high school and college, I do not think you can gain the most out of that period - you are simply too young. In my view, between your junior and senior year is the best time to do it (or between your penultimate and ultimate year of undergraduate education in general). You are just old enough to have experienced enough college, yet you understand the importance of finding a job and/or setting your next course of action. You have gained enough skills or experience that a company might actually think about hiring you or giving you an internship. You are at a point where you must make decisions about the future (always a good motivation) which will push you to try hard no matter what you do. If you are mature, you are ready to take on the real world and can test it out; if you are immature, you must mature ASAP to ensure survival after graduation. I certainly hope that if anyone out there is thinking about taking a gap year and the only thing stopping them is their parents’ traditional way of thinking, this article could serve as great evidence that a gap year, if done correctly, can be extraordinarily beneficial, and to many, necessary. For ease of reading, I have attached the article below: 《專題報導》高中畢業 休息一年再出發 by 本報記者／羅旦兮 03.25.12 - 06:30 am「媽 (爸)，我要休學！」如果家中剛從高中畢業、準備進入大學的青少年這樣宣布，恐怕會讓不少家長心跳停止。每到驪歌初唱的時候，也是高中生從青澀走入大學校園、準備進入成熟的重要階段。不少父母汲汲工作，希望至少協助子女完成大學學業，可是也有越來越多青年選擇在高中畢業、大學入學前，暫停學業，利用時間「探索」自我，掌握人生目標再出發。 這種休學的方式被統稱為「Gap Year」，「Gap Year」被稱為「休學年」、「休耕年」或是「空檔年」，通常是指高中生在畢業後取得大學入學資格，選擇「暫緩」入學，在學習的道路上休息一年，和緊湊的校園生活「小別」。 「休學年」的概念最早出現在歐洲，由於英國的牛津和劍橋大學入學考試在9月，通過考試以後，距離開學的日子還有九個月之多，於是校方便鼓勵學生利用這段閒暇做自己喜歡的事。漸漸地，這習慣蔓延到英國以至歐洲其他學府，成為普遍的風俗，時間也增長至一年左右。 學生「休息一年再出發」的風氣，也逐漸吹到美國，包括普林斯頓、哈佛、安赫斯特學院(Amherst College)、麻省理工學院等名校正式的大學入學規定中，不但允許或鼓勵即將入學的大一新鮮人延遲入學，今年哈佛入學通知單上鼓勵學生考慮休學，而普林斯頓大學甚至為部分大一「休學生」提供「休學規畫」。 十歲隨家人至溫哥華、現為紐約哥倫比亞大學大四學生的朱英楠，可能比同班同學大了一歲，因為在2009年大三時，朱英楠做了一個決定：他要休學，去確定自己未來的人生方向。 「許多中國留學生都在想：『我畢業後，到底是留在美國拿幾年工作經驗，還是直接回國尋找發展機會？』我也不例外，有的人說有幾年華爾街經驗，回國比較容易找工作，可是也有人說現在華爾街經驗在中國根本不吃香」。朱英楠想了好久，問了好多人，當發現沒有人可以給他明確的答案時，他為自己做了決定。朱英楠趁大三升大四、課業和學分都掌握差不多的時候，給自己一年時間，「親自回中國去看看」。 朱英楠在哥大時是「全球中國聯接」 (Global China Connection，簡稱GCC)組織的創始理事，這個完全由留美中國學生組成的非營利機構，旨在促進中國和國際社會在各個行業和領域的溝通與合作。主修經濟的朱英楠以GCC外務事務組副主席的身分，前往北京展開他Gap Year的旅程。 大三暑假前，朱英楠已經拿到許多不錯的實習工作機會，但是為了確定自己未來的方向，朱英楠都忍痛放棄。 朱英楠其實沒有用到一整年的時間，2010年9月開始到2011年5月，八個多月的時間，朱英楠去了青海、麗江、杭州、深圳、香港、武漢和北京。回來之後，他覺得自己「脫胎換骨」。 休息為了充電 走得更長遠 洛杉磯加州大學(UCLA)高等教育研究中心去年曾針對全美30萬名四年制大學大一新生進行一項調查，發現有1.2%的學生是延遲一年入學；高等教育研究所的研究主任助理迪安傑洛(Linda DeAngelo)表示，目前大約有5%的院校明文規定允許學生推遲就學，比率與幾年前相比，有顯著的增長。其他大學則是根據學生的個別申請批准推遲就學。 隨著休學年觀念的推廣，低收費的休學計畫明顯增加，全美各州由政府補助的社區服務，也開始針對休學生擴張活動計畫。推廣「休學年」的美國非營利機構在全美各大學舉辦的「美國休學年博覽會」(U.S. Gap Year Fair)，從四年前只有幾間學校接受，到現在該博覽會已在全美30個定點為青年學生提供正統教育之外的另一種選擇。 「孩子才剛從高中畢業，不上學要做什麼？」這樣的想法應該是大部分家長的擔心。一名協助學生規畫休學年的諮詢人員表示，「休學年」並非漫無目的，許多有意在大學前或大學期間休學的年輕人，通常已經考慮這段時間要達成的計畫或目標，針對這些有理想而不知如何實現的學生，協助規畫休學年的非營利組織也紛紛成立。學生在這段時間去旅行、去海外做義工，或去實習、賺錢。在美國，各類有組織的休學年活動正方興未艾，提供各式各樣的「休學計畫」，協助年輕人把握這一年時間學習第二語言、異國文化、服務社區，或是獨立完成一項研究。 在麻州成立42年的Dynamy是全美推廣「休學年」的元老級非營利機構之一，Dynamy於1969年在麻州成立時，主要為學生蒐集和提供實習機會，以及其他的進修項目，該組織在各地學校舉辦實習博覽會的同時，發現學生們對「休耕」的需要，因此於2007年成立「美國休學年博覽會」。 「如果我唸書時知道有這樣的機會，我一定會把握它，去做自己想做的事。」主任鄭嘉暉表示，根據Dynamy統計，在美國接受「休學年」觀念並付諸實行的，大多是18至22歲的青年，也許他們認為尚未準備好進入大學生活，或是希望透過「休假」一年，以另類方式為自己充電，「進入大學前先休學一年，不是為了玩，而是為了自我充電。」 文化背景不同 家長多憂心 「休學年」對甫從高中畢業的青年也許非常有吸引力，但是對家長，特別是亞裔家長來說，對「有大學不上」這樣的觀念通常是難以茍同。 「你有聽說過哪個NFL的足球運動員，會突然決定要『休息』，去當揹包客環遊世界？哪個球員可以休息一年再回球場衝刺？他們要花多少心力，才能回復原來的職業水平？」美國今日報報導中，一名父親抒發了他對休學的嚴重質疑。就像大部分的父母，都認為做學生的時候，就應該把書唸好，完成人生一個階段後，再去想其他的規畫。 「當我高中剛畢業、和父母提想要休學一年時，父母的反應很激烈，我只好乖乖進大學。」住在麻州的楊伊芙(Eve Young)從高中時代，就知道自己要朝醫學領域前進，並申請到競爭激烈的知名女子私立學院，「高中三年不斷的學習、競爭，加上修了幾堂大學先修課程，我知道進了大學，課業壓力會更大，」楊伊芙的一位女同學在申請到大學後休學一年，申請了獎學金跑到法國學法語，讓她很羨慕，「可是父母說什麼也不讓我這麼做，他們說：『這是不用擔心未來工作的有錢人才能做的事。』」 由於教育文化背景的不同，重視教育的亞裔、猶太裔家長和學生對休學的接受度比較激烈。「休學年」組織諮詢人員指出，當有學生決定休學時，他們要花許多力氣去幫著學生「說服」家長，因為不少家長聽到子女要「先休學」，第一個反應就是「會不會就因此不去上學了？」 「爸媽聽我說要休學，第一個反應是『為什麼不畢業再去做這些事？』」朱英楠說，父母覺得他只剩一年就要畢業，應該老老實實地唸書，他笑說：「媽媽反對得最厲害，一開口就是『不准！』」反而是爸爸聽完他的想法後，跟他說：「你別給自己這麼大壓力，該做什麼就去做。」朱英楠花了許多工夫，讓父母了解他的想法，並在返回哥大唸書後，在自己的博客上列出過去近一年努力的成績，宛如履歷表的日誌，讓朱家兩老對兒子休學做了哪些事有一點概念，「不過媽媽可能到現在還是不太了解，為什麼當初我想做這件事」。 而爭取休學不成的楊伊芙，後來還是依「人生計畫」，進入大學成為新鮮人，雖然課業壓力大，功課仍一直名列前茅，「每天清晨5點起床就是唸書，一直唸到就寢，別人說大學新鮮人的校園生活都是多采多姿，我只覺得越來越不快樂。」 因為沉重的壓力，楊伊芙情緒出現極大問題，不願意再留在該校就讀。大一學期結束後她申請轉學到另一所知名大學，但她很擔心未來的大學生活還是一樣，只有壓力沒有快樂，「我根本無法想像自己能不能撐過剩下的三年。」和心理諮詢師深談後，她決定暫緩上學，參與「Dynamy」的休學計畫。看到女兒日漸憔悴的臉龐，這次，楊伊芙的父母不再反對。 選擇休學一年 理由千百種 「休學年優勢：對你的子女在進入大學前後的助益」共同作者海格勒(Karl Haigler)和尼爾森 (Rae Nelson)，曾經對高中畢業生選擇休學一年的原因做過調查，發現美國高中畢業生選擇延遲進入大學，是因為「在高中時高度競爭的壓力使他們疲累」，以及「想更了解自己」。 華爾街日報指出，經濟一直無法復甦，越來越多的學生自我「休學」一年賺學費，不過也有更多學生是為了「發現自我潛能」或「開拓眼界」。 報導指出，休學生在休學期間會做的事情範圍很廣，除了打工賺錢，有的跑去擔任社區義工，有的去旅遊、從事戶外活動，有的去上充實自我課程，也有些畢業於精英高中的學生在高壓的競爭下，獲得名校錄取後主動休學紓解壓力。 華爾街日報報導，伊利諾州的派克(Ben Parker)說，休學年的體驗讓他的學業有了轉折性的改變。高中最後一年，進入知名大學的壓力令他幾乎崩潰，他離開了長曲棍球隊，成績也越來越糟糕。帕克對華爾街日報說，跟父母交談之後，「我們認為現在進大學只是個浪費。我還沒有做好準備。」因此在收到愛阿華大學(University of Iowa)的錄取通知書之後，帕克沒有入學，而是去了懷俄明州的戶外技能培訓機構─美國國家戶外領導力學校(National Outdoor Leadership School)。之後他去尼泊爾待了一個學期，住在一個村子裡，學習語言，攀登喜馬拉雅山。 現年20歲的派克如今已是大學二年級的學生，他說，他又重新擁有了接受嚴酷考驗並樂在其中的能力，「回到學校的時候，我已經做好了學習的準備。」他的成績開始名列前茅，後來還擔任校園文學雜誌的編輯。 Dynamy主任鄭嘉暉認為這類「休學再出發」的學習方式有許多優點：讓學生在進入大學生活、準備從青年變成成人的時期，以非傳統的方式自我教育，認識自己；或是在自己想要鑽研的專業領域上開闊眼界，她指出，在DYMANY的活動中，就有已被康乃爾大學接受、準備唸教育科系的學生，先辦休學到中國了解亞洲的教育系統；也有攻讀Social Justice的學生申請到緬甸等東南亞國家，認識其他地方的法律，「這些對學生來說不僅是大開眼界，也為他們日後面對大學繁重的課程打下基礎，在唸書時可以更了解課堂內容。」 目前Dynamy每年約幫助近50位學生，雖然該機構服務的學生以麻州居多，也近年來也有來自德州、佛羅里達甚至瑞典的學生，透過休學一邊修學分、邊充實自己。 「有時不是學生要說服家長讓他們休學來充電，反而是倒過來，家長建議子女休息一年再出發。」鄭嘉暉說，部分青年選擇休學一年的原因，可能是申請到的學校並不是他心目中最理想的學校，「透過一年休學的服務經歷再重新申請，可以提高學校錄取學生的機會。」 「教育心理學雜誌」 (Journal of Educational Psychology)曾經刊登了一篇澳洲研究人員針對2502名學生進行的調查，文章認為，體驗空檔年會讓學生在大學期間更有進取心。「休學年優勢：對你的子女在進入大學前後的助益」作者黑格勒的調研則發現，體驗休學年的學生當中有90%會在一年內回返學校，但也有些學生在休學年之後迷失了方向，乾脆就不上學了。為了預防學生退學，黑格勒建議不妨要求學生先辦理入學手續，然後再休學一年。 休學開眼界 重新規畫人生 華爾街日報報導，住在科羅拉多州的18歲盧姿(Monica Lutz)夢想是去貧困國家工作，幫助解決當地的經濟和社會問題。因此當她從高中畢業後，沒有直接去上大學，而是在家人朋友的提議下休學一年，去一家公司上班，這家公司致力於將太陽能技術推廣到印度的一個偏遠村莊，她被派往印度進行推廣。 但是，在一個泥土砌成的房子生活了幾周之後，她改變了主意。她覺得，在此過程中面臨的種種障礙令她身心俱疲，於是她告訴自己，「我還沒有準備好，無法獻身於這個事業」。 同一年秋季，盧姿開始了大學生活，她打算重新考慮自己的職業規畫。她說：「如果沒有休假一年，我也許會在花了四年時間和20萬美元的學費之後，在同樣的國家得出同樣的結論。」 楊伊芙2008年順利從塔虎茲大學畢業，回首當年的決定，她認為是非常必要的，「如果當時沒有休學，我可能畢不了業，成了大學輟學生。」 楊伊芙在休學的近半年裡，她透過Dynamy組織到其他大學修了非本科的英語和社會學，到音樂工作室實習，並參與國際非營利組織，在社區宣導重視國際饑荒問題。「我覺得那半年做的事情比學校生活更忙碌，但是開拓了我的眼界，」楊伊芙說，校園學習生活雖然也很緊湊，「但(校園生活)就是按表操課，我唯一要關心的只有功課、成績，對其他事務沒有任何興趣，完全不知道要去找學習和生活的平衡點，結果生活一團糟，自己越來越不快樂」。 她覺得透過Dynamy的規畫，鞭策她一邊忙碌於達到實習目標，一邊重新認識自我價值，「原來這個世界上還有其他許多值得我們去探索的領域。」楊伊芙返回校園後，坦言自己有了不小的改變，「我以前只知道專注於醫學，現在對教育也有興趣，」楊伊芙現在課餘會到高中擔任課後輔導，聆聽青少年學生的煩惱，並分享自己的經驗。 在華裔學生眾多的紐約知名高中史岱文森高中擔任學業輔導員的王稚鶴，他坦言雖然聽過學生討論申請到大學後先休學一年，但「實際付諸行動者極其不普遍，少之又少」。王稚鶴認為這與美國大學教育系統，以及華人傳統的教育觀念有關，「在台灣的大學制度裡，新鮮人在大一時就各自選好科系，但是在美國，大部分大學生可以到大二下學期才決定專門攻讀的科系。」他指出，既然不必一進大學就要為讀哪個科系傷腦筋，自然也就不需花額外時間尋找自己對未來規畫的方向。 王稚鶴說，在他擔任高中輔導員的時間裡，只有一位學生獲哈佛大學錄取後，先休學一年，但這位學生是因為受重傷的特殊原因，才向學校申請停學。 王稚鶴說，一些學生家境不是那麼富裕，沒有拿到大學獎學金，或是沒有獲得學校聘用，在學費考量下，也可能休學一年賺取學費，同時賺取生活經驗。不過華人學生較少在高中畢業後休學自我衝刺的最大原因，「應該是家長的考慮。」他指出，華人家長會擔心子女停學的一年裡無所事事。 一年誰金援？ 學術機構支持 一位有五名子女的家長在網上直接表明立場：「我不可能讓我的小孩做休學的事，除非那一年他們可以花費自理。」這位署名「五子之母」的網友說，剛畢業的青年心智成熟度不一定足夠，金錢觀念也還沒建立完全，她覺得學校不應該鼓吹高中生一畢業就去「尋找自我」，「如果這『休學年』期間的經濟花費還是要靠父母，那還不如乖乖去唸書。」 很多學生在休學年裡打工賺學費，或是在高中時就先打工積存「休學基金」。紐約時報報導，住在紐約的凱雅利用高中最後四個月努力打工，加上原本的積蓄，高中一畢業就跑到玻利維亞 (Bolivia)，參與聯合國非營利組織的一個教育項目；紐約上州史卡斯岱爾高中生克里斯托夫一畢業，和另一名志同道和的同學先後到中國清華大學和大連語言學校學中文，並且打工賺生活費用，最後幾個月他們到了西藏，在西藏迷路摸索的幾個月中，他看到「比原來更大的世界」，而克里斯托夫的父親則將兒子的休學經歷刊登在紐約時報上，引起不小迴響。 基督教科箴言報(Christian Science Monitor)指出，有越來越多包括大學的學術機構，為休學的青年提供經濟上的協助。根據報導，目前約有超過80所大學提供對等獎學金，給參與非營利性組織政府機構美國志工團 (AmeriCorps)服務的學生，該義工團給予獎學金的金額從2009年的一年4725元，上升到今年的5500元。北卡羅萊納州立大學教堂山莊分校 (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)去年獲得一筆150萬元的捐款，專門協助大學新鮮人去完成他們的休學年計畫。 耶魯大學雖然沒有直接提供經濟上的援助，但該校的「橋年計畫」(Bridge Year Program)鼓勵學生延遲入學，參與該計畫的學生必須在美國境外學習，與其他耶魯學生住在寄養家庭，而學習費用全免。 耶魯2009至2010年的「Bridge Year」計畫，將學生們送去了祕魯、迦納或塞爾維亞，該計畫並非人人得以參與，2009年共有54名學生秋季入學時申請，僅有20位獲得去海外免費學習的機會。 社區部分非營利組織也針對休學年設計學習計畫，對於沒有明確計畫的學生，通常會報名參加那些有組織的活動專案，不過學生需在費用方面多加評比，有些工作職位會給薪水和獎學金，另一些則需要收取費用，費用可高達3萬5000元。 除了上述的DYNAMY，USA Gap Year Fair羅列出美國多個休學年組織，學生可以比較各種規畫的優劣與合適性；2004年幾位美國大學生在完成休學年的活動後成立了Omprakash，也提供學生查詢各地實習或做義工的管道。 不過，很多低開銷的服務計畫頗難申請。去年，City Year和美國志工團 (AmeriCorps)旗下全美民間社區服務團 (National Civilian Community Corps)的申請人數，都比服務計畫可容納人數的數倍。 過來人建議 讓休學有意義 非營利機構「休學年」 (gapyear.com)定期在網路上舉辦休學年網路論壇，2011年12月初，多位曾經在生涯規畫中「休息再出發」的背包客專家和媒體人，在網路上為有意暫停學業的青年給予實用建議。 一名計畫在學年之間休學的網友想到澳洲「充實自我」，但是發現當地物價頗高，令他裹足不前。專家指出，澳洲因為很早便開始推廣休學年，為「休學年」青年規畫的服務和項目都很完善，的確有不少青年以澳洲作為休學前進海外的首選，不過專家也認為如果在經濟考量的前提下，東南亞和拉丁美洲也是可以增廣見聞的地區，專家們表示，許多義工項目其實也有支付薪水，青年們不妨優先考慮。 如果是到海外，到底是要帶現金去？還是帶張信用卡？專家建議不妨申請一張借貸卡 (Debit card)，或是申請預付信用卡 (Pre-paid card)，平常使用的信用卡僅作為備用，並且事先了解自己銀行對海外提款索取的費用；最重要的是「不要將所有雞蛋放在同一個籃子裡」，將卡片和現金分開放置，避免丟了皮包大失血。 朱英楠休學八個月返回中國，最大的感觸是現實社會與校園生活真的很不同，「現實生活中，沒人會因為你做得好而給你獎勵，也沒有人義務要當你的朋友，」不過他不認為這是一種負面的感受，反而是激發他的能量。「北京是個競爭很激烈的城市，人們都會積極地去達到自己的目的，」他在北京期間更深刻了解待人處事之道，「想久一點、多一點，比準備不充足好」 另外一個他想給有意到中國的青年，不論做什麼事，要表現鎮定，「在學校，學生幾乎很少想到年齡問題，因為大家都差不多年紀，可是在社會裡，你的言行必須足夠成熟，否則會給人『不靠譜』的印象。」朱英楠說，在西方，年輕普遍被認為是充滿活力、精神十足的象徵，可是到了北京，年輕代表不成熟，無法負以重任。朱英楠剛到北京時，也會在意自己的年紀會無法獲得別人的尊重，可是越到後來，他不用刻意去想自己是個才22歲的大學生，與大公司或舉辦大型活動時的表現也越來越「淡定」。 「雖然跑了很多地方，但自己知道會在北京花最多時間。」朱英楠說，北京是中國的文化中心、政治中心，而且他的朋友也都在北京，他回到中國後，先是在清華大學旁聽課程，並遞履歷申請到北京的大公司實習。朱英楠並在停留期間，在北京召開「全球中國聯接」活動，讓北京各大學學生認識並參與該組織的活動。 「我覺得休學的這段期間給我很大的意義，我長大了許多，」朱英楠說，無論學校有多好，「它永遠像個泡泡，包覆著學生，讓學生不受傷害，當你真正走出校園，接觸到的東西完全不同。」© worldjournal.com 2012]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[… Traffic. That’s all that I can think of as I sit through hours of traffic every day since I came back to China. For old times’ sake, I set my Google Calendar to the week of October 18th, 2009. That week I had 10 classes, 4 meetings, 3 career networking events, 2 dance practices, 2 dance performances, 2 a capella rehearsals, 1 coffee chat, 1 dinner, 1 social event, and Homecoming. Columbia. It was all possible then. Doing everything and missing nothing. Going between all of those obligations took around 5 minutes each way (with the exception of Homecoming which was 100 blocks up north on another planet called Bakers Field). I buy what Malcolm Gladwell wrote in Outliers. Based on his theory of success, our entire academic, social, and career achievements are made possible because we are able to allocate enough time doing each of them. Essentially, practice makes perfect. In college, I was able to waste little to no time every day. Now I spend hours in traffic daily. Here, sitting in this metal frame with glass windows, surrounded by carbon dioxide, skyscrappers, and countless number of people on foot, bicycles, motorcycles, coupes, SUVs, vans, and buses, everyone seems desperately wanting to get somewhere, but no one seems to be moving. Motorcyclists take sharp turns without glancing behind. Cyclists ride on the automobile lanes and slow down everyone behind them. Buses use their only advantage of size to squeeze ahead, trying desperately to meet their daily rounds… Aha! A green light. Good. But not good enough. It’ll take another 2 green lights before I even make it to the front of the line. And after this green light, there’ll be another 10 of those before I get home. 10 lights. 30 green lights to wait. 70 seconds each. Total of 35 minutes for a distance of 5km. Averaging &lt;9km/hr. I’m beginning to think that people in China purchase cars so that they could run without getting rained on. In major cities across China, most people spend far too much time getting from work to home, then grocery shop, cook, eat, clean, leisure (an luxury item), and sleep. More and more can be accomplished on mobile phones or computers, but most things in China still require physical visits - work, school, banks, hospitals, malls, business meetings. In Beijing and Shanghai, subways stations are so big that you spend half the time walking instead of riding a train. In my hometown of Wuhan, the first subway line won’t be opening until 2014. The upkeep of a car (parking, gasoline, fines) has become so high that some people would only drive on weekends and bus to work instead - with traffic it takes about the same amount of time anyway. I’m worried. Not just for my capacity, but for the capacity of this country. No one expects anyone to be on time because it is impossible to be. Yes, people are getting wealthier, and many are buying their first cars. But the flow of traffic is like the flow of blood in the human body, and the cars are clogging up the cities’ arteries.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[As recruitment season for summer internships is coming up, I’ve been getting some inquiries about a number of issues concerning interning in finance in Asia. One question in particular pretty much tops all lists as the most-frequently-asked question: Did you ever contemplate working in New York instead of Hong Kong? If so, why did you pick Hong Kong over New York? My answer is probably the same as most people that have studied in the US and have an interest in China: Yes, we all have. Why you are asking, and why I asked the same thing about a year ago:Understandably, choosing a job or a career is probably the single most important decision you have ever had to make. The last big decision you had to make was probably which college to attend, but parents usually had a pretty big influence on that. This time it’s different. Our parents might have had some knowledge of how colleges ranked and how the application system worked, but they know almost nothing about how to find a job in a big firm or how campus recruitment works when it comes to finance/consulting (unless of course, your parents worked for one of the bulge bracket firms in which case you shouldn’t be reading this article at all). The most they’ve heard of is that the son or daughter of so-and-so got hired by some big-name firm even before graduation - because nosy family friends love to gossip about this stuff, as if those kids didn’t even need to apply and some company CEO just magically handed them job offers on a silver platter. After debating with your parents for a year or two, hopefully demystifying the recruitment system and discrediting your aunts, uncles, and friendly neighbors, you realize that you are pretty much on your own. Depending on your parents’ level of English and financial literacy, they may think that becoming a banker means that you’ll be sitting behind a cashier and helping people with their deposits and withdrawals; if you’re lucky, they may think you take rich people’s money and help them buy and sell stocks; if you are really lucky, they may actually understand that you are going to take companies like Groupon or Michael Kors to an “IPO.” The term “consultant” is even more ubiquitous and difficult to explain because there are simply too many different types of consultants. Unless your parents work in the industry, there is very little chance that they will understand what kind of job you’re really applying for. So regardless of how lucky you are, your parents are of little help. And for the first time in your life, a big decision is pretty much all on you. What to do about it:I’ve said this many times before but here it is again: The best way to answer a “what if” question is by trying it out. I highly recommend taking a gap year to really dig deep. But not everyone wants to/can do that. So what you can do otherwise, is to build a mental model of what it would be like if you worked in Hong Kong or New York (or Beijing, Shanghai, London, Dubai, São Paulo - anywhere for that matter). If you can convince yourself that the outcome of one place is better than all the rest, you can go ahead and pick that one. After all, you just need convince yourself that your final decision is the “right” one - whether or not it’s actually better than the rest doesn’t even matter and isn’t even relevant because you will never get to test it out. In reality, we overestimate how much impact a major decision like this will have on our happiness. If you are able to make it into finance or consulting in any of these big cities, you are already in good shape to become a high-earning white-collar and retire with plenty of vacation money. And if all you wanted was to do a two-year stunt in a prestigious firm just to show that you can, doing so in New York vs. anywhere else doesn’t matter nearly as much as how prestigious the firm is. Just as your educational outcome may not have differed much had you gone to Princeton instead of Yale, so too your professional success may not be all that different if you decided to pick Barcap ECM over BAML NRG. However, if you think your life’s dream involves much greater ambition than just becoming a white-collar, then your task is a little bit harder - you’ll need to figure out what that dream is first, before you do anything else. School, I find, is a terrible place to discover one’s true passion, because school is nothing like the world you will have to deal with once you are outside of it (unless you go into academia). For one of my business school classes, we were assigned to a book called Managing with Power by Jeffrey Pfeffer on the importance of power when one desires to make impact on this world. A section entitled “Lessons to Be Unlearned“ summed up a few very important points that all college grads should keep in mind: Despite what we have learned all our lives growing up, life is not a matter of individual effort, ability, and achievement. As the author puts it, “the private knowledge and private skill that are so useful in the classroom are insufficient in organizations. Individual success in organizations is quite frequently a matter of working with and through other people, and organizational success is often a function of how successfully individuals can coordinate their activities.” In short - drop your books and join some clubs. In most classes, there are always right vs. wrong answers, but real life doesn’t. I like to think of school life vs. the real life as an Venn diagram, where there is a portion of school life that can be applied to real life, but a large chunk of it is pretty irrelevant.But here comes the more important part - the reality of decision-making: A decision by itself changes nothing At the moment a decision is made, we cannot possibly know whether it is good or bad We invariably spend more time living with the consequences of our decisions than we do in making themSo instead of pulling your hair out trying to decide “New York or Hong Kong” before graduation, focus on implementing the decision and maximizing your returns whatever you decide to do and wherever you decide to go. John Legend became a singer after three years at BCG; Peter Peterson went from Secretary of Commerce to co-founder of Blackstone. Anything can change after a good start. As self-righteous homo sapiens, we will always find ways to justify our decisions later and play 事后诸葛亮, but the most important thing is that we do everything we can to make the most out of every situation.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[I walk down the stairs of Low Plaza. As far as Columbia is concerned, I stand at the center of the universe. Unknowingly, I filled in the scantron, signed my name under the honor code, finished my last sentence with a period, packed up my backpack, handed in my exam, and walked out of the classroom… … for the last time. Possibly in this lifetime. The gate of memories swings open. Freshman, sophomore, junior, senior. A part of me just died. Officially. Ironically, for my very last paragraph of my very last essay on my very last final exam in my college career, I was writing about Jonathan Evan’s theory of the dual-process account of reasoning. Two processes live in our minds, one that is quick, efficient, intuitive, and prone to mistakes; the other slower, effortful, evolutionarily recent, and reliable. The latter accounted for our normative and rational decisions, while the former our irrational and emotional ones. My last paragraph essentially attacked the field of economics and bashed the assumptions that humans are, for the most part, rational agents and utility maximizers - we are neither. We know to collaborate in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, to be altruistic even if it goes against our own well-being; we are situationally adaptive yet universally categorizable; we are at once emotionally rational and rationally emotional. The philosophers championed reason, enabled by the second system and credited for transforming this planet from soil and plants to concrete and skyscrapers. Yet reason, who has been convincing me that this moment shall be a happy, triumphant one, cannot explain to me my feeling of loss. By tomorrow this moment will seem like a dream, rationalized by reason, and stored away into memory’s abyss. But right now, this moment is beautiful. If the second system is distinctively human, then it is the first system that makes us human at all.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[The title of this post is inspired by the well-known investment book, _A Random Walk Down Wall Street _by Burton G. Malkiel (1973). I’ve never read the book, but the idea that Malkiel tried to convey is pretty easy to summarize: Since stock prices cannot be predicted in the short term, argues Malkiel, individual investors are better off buying and holding onto index funds than meddling with securities or actively managing mutual funds. Not only will a broad range of index funds outperform a professionally managed portfolio in the long run, but investors can avoid expense charges and trading costs, which decrease returns. […] His witty, acerbic style and persuasive arguments will delight readers but, alas, leave Wall Street unmoved.

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[At 4:11pm today, I received an email from the University entitled “Security Alert 11.12.11”. Below is the email message: We have been notified by the NYPD, that on November 12, 2011 at about 7:30 p.m. two males were the victim of an attempted robbery in the lobby of a brownstone on W. 114 St. between Broadway and Amsterdam Ave. The suspect […] was sitting on the steps of the brownstone and followed the first victim into the hallway. He displayed a gun and demanded the victim’s I-phone [sic]. When the victim stated he didn’t have an I-phone, the male gave it back to him. The second victim entered the hallway and the suspect demanded his Iphone. Once again the suspect handed it back when he found out it was not actually an Iphone. The suspect left the building and fled on foot down Amsterdam Ave. For your information, “W. 114th St. between Broadway and Amsterdam Ave.” is exactly where I live. The robbery might as well have taken place in my building. This is about the third or forth crime reported this year around the school, but I am particularly shocked at this one. &nbsp; &nbsp; The robber was already pointing a gun at somebody, committing a crime, and left empty-handed because the phone wasn’t an iPhone. He basically said no to the watch (~$120), no to the TI-83 (~$100), no to the laptop (~$1000+), no to the iPod (~$200), no to non-smart phones (~$100), and no to every other smartphone ever invented besides the iPhone! I’m not sure if I should be laughing at his failed criminal act or admiring his steadfastness to the iPhone. Steve Jobs would be proud. Perhaps secretly. Regardless of how I resolve my cognitive dissonance, if you have an iPhone, consider putting it back in the box and take out that Blackberry you retired from last year. Watch out RIM, here’s your chance. (Not really.) Update Nov. 21, 2011: You’ve got to be kidding me. This guy (or his good friend) came back! Security Alert today: On November 21, 2011 at about 11:50 p.m., a student was the victim of an attempted robbery on W.114St. between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. The student accompanied by another person was accosted as she was walking on the north side of W.114 St. towards Broadway. The suspect pushed the victim against a fence, threatened her and demanded her I-phone [sic]. When the suspect learned she did not have an I- phone, he fled east towards Amsterdam Avenue without taking any property. The suspect is observed on video walking back and forth on W. 114 St. prior to the crime. Moments earlier, he followed a student into Ruggles Hall but left the building immediately. If you have any information about this crime or this suspect, contact the 26Pct Detective Unit at 212-__678-1351 or contact the undersigned. If you observe this person on the street, call the police immediately by dialing 911. The incident is so serious that the University’s VP Public Safety wrote a letter addressing this issue: In the past few weeks you have received several Security Alerts regarding crimes in our community. In particular, there has been a series of robberies and attempted robberies on W. 114th Street. I am writing to let you know that the safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff, as well as others in our community, is our top priority. I would also like to share with you some of the things that the Department of Public Safety is doing to safeguard our campus, and the 114th Street area in particular, in order to help allay any concerns that you may have on the issue of safety here at Columbia… I’m looking forward to the “iPhones Cause Crimes on Ivy League Campus” article in the next edition of the New York Times.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Before reading anything, please watch and contrast these two videos: [youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YIF-ejSHdM&amp;w=853&amp;h=480] [youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofpYRITtLSg&amp;w=420&amp;h=315] As you can probably expect from the videos, the injured dog lived, and the 2-year-old girl died on October 21st, 2011. Enough has been written about the Chinese incident online. The WSJ reported that Chinese observers and journalists have blamed the apparent apathy on “everything from the trauma of the Cultural Revolution to fear of legal action to Chinese culture itself.” In observing Chinese culture, James McGregor, former CEO of Dow Jones &amp; Company China and one of GCC’s Senior Advisors, gives a revealing explanation in his book, One Billion Customers: Firm control from the top has always been considered the only path to peace and prosperity in China. One reason is that China is a shame-based society, very different from the guilt-based West. In the West, with society’s religious orientation, many controls are internalized. Guilt, which is ultimately the fear of sin and eternal damnation, puts a check on bad behavior. In China, it is the fear of exposure and the accompany shame that tarnishes the entire extended family. As a result, the Chinese can feel pretty good about doing almost anything as long as they don’t get caught. In that atmosphere, the only efficient form of law and order is a strong and omnipresent government that increases the likelihood of getting caught if you do something wrong. One Billion Customers (McGregor, 2005) If we borrow McGregor’s frame and project it onto a gross generalization of the whole Chinese population and all of their possible actions, it is a scary thought that people aren’t killing each other and stealing each other’s money only because they don’t want to be caught doing so. An equally depressing blogger concluded that “China seems to have become so utilitarian that it can’t understand or even tolerate people who do things for altruistic reasons“ (emphasis added). But even with an ultra-utilitarian system, not everyone’s sociopathic or else we wouldn’t have the society we have today. Altruism isn’t nonexistent in China, and utilitarianism isn’t the main problem. The Chinese may be overtly obsessed with money and wealth, but even that doesn’t warrant the actions witnessed in the first video. The problem, in my opinion, is trust. And there is none. Chinese cities are infiltrated with deceptive and malicious schemes aimed straight at your wallet: phone calls, texts, and even strangers calling for “help.” This accompanied by the media whose job is to sell these stories that keep people on their feet. Take a look at Baidu’s Top Ten search items daily and you’ll learn what catches the Chinese people’s attention - not how to make money (surprise!), but what to watch-out for in China: poisonous food &amp; beverages, corrupt government officials, ineffective legal system, natural disasters, prostitution, even random stranger stealing your new-born child from the hospital. Scared? Me too. There are few Good Samaritans in China not because people have no faith or belief or have lost their souls, but because the Good Samaritans have either been tricked in the past or have heard too many horror stories to maintain their confidence in strangers. The basic rule to survival, as anyone who has traveled the country would quickly learn, is to not trust anyone. People are constantly living in an environment where they feel unsafe. It didn’t need to be a 2-year-old girl; it could’ve been a full-grown adult lying there. People would need to start gathering around him, starring from a distance, muttering conjectures in each other’s ears; finally, when enough people have gathered around to make it feel “safe,” when it feels like there are enough witnesses and no one is going to hold you responsible for what has happened, someone might jump in and do the right thing - help. That’s typically what you’d see if someone is dying on the streets in China. Populated streets with many pedestrians. In China, you can expect help from a friend, a colleague, a distant relative, or anyone that has the slightest knowledge of who you are or who you might be. But don’t expect the help of a stranger.]]></content>

      <url>%2F2011%2F10%2F25%2Fwas-this-occupy-wall-street%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[The Scare I was in Philadelphia two weekends ago, when Occupy Wall Street had just popped up on my laptop screen for a few days. I was attending an info session for GCC-UPenn and was about to head back to New York. I was in a suit and carried a briefcase. I was buying a bottle of green tea at the bus stop stand when the guy, after ignoring me for a full 30 seconds chatting with his friends, offered me $18 for the bottle. I startled. He laughed and said it was only $2. He then checked me up and down and asked his friends, “How much do you think this guy makes? $300k a year?” He turned toward me. “Ain’t that right? $300,000?” I paused. At this point I think my sympathetic nervous system was fully at work. In the interest of self-protection, I said, “No I’m still a student looking for a job, that’s why I’m dressed like this.” Not far from the truth. At least not as far as the difference between 300k and however much I might be making if I were actually working right now. Did I look that old? Or did he just have no idea how much men-in-suits typically make? Blame me for being overly sensitive but, I’ve wore a suit in the US since 10th grade MUN conferences, and this was the first time that I felt a bit threatened because of it. The Interview Room A few days later, a friend of mine went into an interview and was asked a question about Occupy Wall Street. “So what do you think of the protest?” “I think it’s a big waste of time. These people should spend their time and energy finding a job instead,” the interviewee said. Lucky for him, the interviewer actually felt the same way. But such response is far too risky at a sensitive time like this. What if you met someone who liked everything in politically correct terms? And if this article from last week’s the Atlantic didn’t convince you to never mention “money” as one of your motivations during interview, I don’t know what will. What This Mean to You Regardless of whether or not Occupy Wall Street ever took place, people in finance are going to be making less in the foreseeable future. Banks are already downsizing their risks as well as number of employees. To borrow from Mergers &amp; Inquisitions‘s recent blog on Occupy Wall Street, “nowadays people go into Wall Street _expecting _to get rich, whereas in the 1980s they went to Wall Street hoping to get rich.” So if anything, the recent protest should really make those who are still “thinking” about going into finance to really dig deep and examine the core motivations behind their career choices. And when all else fail to answer your inquiries - take a gap year.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[So the recent Occupy Wall Street movement got me curious to look into what percentage of people at Columbia go into finance. I flipped through the CCE (Columbia’s Center for Career Education) website to see if they’ve got this sheet of statistic on where Columbia students end up working after graduation. It turns out they still have it. And the numbers have escaped me since I last saw them back in 2007 during my CCE orientation as a freshman… Part I - The Stats [scribd id=68593382 key=key-2isb1kv49lqd5yfid7dg mode=list] An astonishing 24.9% of the Class of 2010 in CC and SEAS ended up working in financial services, with an additional 9.1% in consulting. SEAS graduate programs yield a whopping 32.9% for finance and 9.2% for consulting. (For a school as specialized as “engineering,” this could almost warrant a change in the school’s name.) [scribd id=68598346 key=key-l7oxppvyik4vsv7wo2l mode=list] Now I got really curious and, before we begin to judge Columbia, let’s take a look at Harvard. [caption id=”attachment_324” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”Source: Seniors Survey, Office of Career Services, Harvard University”][/caption] On the Charles River, over the past five years, we see a few trends: smaller percentage of students in finance/consulting, fewer in military, more in non-profit, health/medicine, communications/media/arts, and business (presumably this is where entrepreneurship would fall). Since we don’t have trend data by industry for Columbia, it’s hard to make trend comparisons. But just taking the 2010 data alone, 33% of Harvard seniors planned to work in finance or consulting - almost at the same level as Columbia’s 34% (though showing a noticeable difference where consulting firms historically have a stronger preference for Harvard than Columbia). At its height, 47% of Harvard seniors planned to work in finance or consulting in 2008 (just before the financial crisis). I’d assume Columbia’s 2008 numbers were probably similar. You can check out UPenn, Princeton, and Cornell. So I’ve been asked this many times and have wondered this myself - why do so many students from top universities end up in finance or consulting? Here’s my take on why. Part II - The Qualitative Analysis Let’s admit it - for most of us, we have no idea of what we want to do after college. For starters, we all know that this campus is skewed toward finance and consulting (because that’s all that we hear about) - but for the average-over-achieving-Ivy-Leaguers, it’s just too difficult to accept that we will end up pretty mainstream and pick what everybody else picked - finance and/or consulting. We think somehow there’s a destiny awaiting, a path beckoning, a road less travelled-by, and honor, glory, and fame are within our grasp - and _right now _is the moment to capture it before we are stuck forever in some cubicle in some office building in some major metropolitan area somewhere on this planet. We misperceive the fact that we have made it to the top 1% of the higher-education population (a system based on getting good grades, being well-rounded, and/or excel in one particular area) should be automatically translated into becoming the top 0.1% of the higher-income population (a system based on hard-work, inheritance, networks, economic conditions, and chance). After all, if we have beaten the odds at getting into the best schools, shouldn’t we also beat the odds at making the most amount of money and impact? We assume that life is supposed to get better and better - the same assumption for economic growth, stock indices, and real estate prices in the long-term - and look where that’s gotten us today. Some of us will actually take action to address this dilemma - picking the “Main Street” or being a maverick - most of us will just wait it out and succumb last minute. But even for the brave few I’ve seen, it is usually the same story: They get super excited about a seemingly brilliant idea and invest a lot of time and energy into it; a few months later, when miracle fails to surface (e.g. no venture capital is throwing down millions of dollar for them to play with, or the realization that being a real [read: poor] entrepreneur is too big a step-down from their dream lifestyle of beach-houses and Lamborghini’s), they quickly loses interest and rethink - Epiphany hits and they come to the realization that finance/consulting, and not something else, is the way to go. Because it gives you “a good training.” But it’s not just the Ivy League, it’s everybody. To quote Seth Davis from the opening scene of Boiler Room (2000): I read this article a while back that said that Microsoft employs more millionaire secretaries than any other company in the world. They took stock options over Christmas bonuses. It was a good move. I remember there was this photograph of one of the groundskeepers next to his Ferrrari. Blew my mind. You see s* like that, and it just plants seeds, makes you think it’s possible, even easy**. And then you turn on the TV, and there’s just more of it. The 87 million dollar lottery winner. That kid actor that just made $20 million on his last movie. That Internet stock that shot through the roof. You could have made millions on it if you’d just got in early. And that’s exactly what I wanted to do: get in. I didn’t want to be an innovator. I just wanted to make the quick and easy buck. I just wanted in. Notorious B.I.G. said it best: Either you’re slinging crack rock, or you got a wicked jump shot.’ Nobody wants to work for it anymore. There’s no honor in taking the after school job at Mickey D’s. Honor’s in the dollar, kid. So I went the white boy way of slinging crack rock. I became a stock broker. [Fast-forward** to 2011] “… so I went the Asian kid’s way of becoming a stock broker. I became an investment banker.”** The movie version of the finance world is a bit exaggerated because it focused on the worst portion of the industry. But the dilemma of being a maverick vs. choosing the main road nonetheless exists. Part III - Is this a problem and, if so, is there a solution? Trends are difficult to resist. It’s how they became trends in the first place. You use an iPhone? Own a pair of boat shoes? Ever noticed how many Macs users are on college campuses? We follow trends. Because trends exist to appeal, because most people want to be liked, and because there is usually very little justification for not following trends. When I spoke at the GCC-Carnegie Conference in June, Chenggang Rui, CCTV’s star anchor who goes around interviewing prominent businessmen and politicians, wrapped up his keynote address with a serious concern over the world’s (and China’s) talent pools. “If the guys working for Wall Street are more well-rounded and always had better grades in college than the guys working for the government, then how can the regulators ever outsmart the regulated?” He asked the audience. This talent dynamics is a losing proposition for the government and can only result in more problems in financial regulation down the line. While Rui’s concern may be an over-simplification of the US political system and Wall Street, his concern is right in that too many people want to work in finance… especially in China. In China, everybody and his grandma wants to major in finance and work in an investment bank. I’ve seen people with Masters, JD’s, and even PhD’s in fields completely unrelated to finance/economics dishing out resumes to banks and consulting firms. Sadly, we should probably acknowledge to ourselves that our best educated people will be a generation of financial professionals - at least among the ethnic Chinese. So we’ve identified the problem, but very few solutions - encouraging students to participate in government, non-profit, education, and business sectors outside of finance/consulting? But what’s the best way to “encourage”? Run a calculation on the expenses associated with college education (especially at the top schools) and you’ll find justification for why everyone wants to make more rather than less. How about teach less about finance and teach more about happiness? Maybe, but it needs to become mainstream to make a real impact (e.g. One day becoming part of the CORE curriculum at Columbia). During my time at Columbia, a new major called “Financial Economics” emerged, and a new minor in “Business Management” is on its way to become one of the most popular selections. Corporate Finance and Accounting and Finance expanded into two sections due to popular demand, and the neighboring Barnard College also began to offer more courses in economics. College students like to blame the banks for spending money to recruit on Ivy League campuses. But the relationships between college caree officers, banks/consulting firms, and the student job-seekers are a matter of freedom of choice. Government and non-profits can either pay the same kind of money to recruit on college campuses, or they can shift people’s opinions to a point where the honor associated with working for government/non-profit is greater than the monetary gains of working anywhere else. Until then, those percentages shown at the top are unlikely to move significantly. There is a bright side to this: most people stay in finance or consulting for only a few years before moving onto something else. So perhaps there is an alternative solution, not at the undergraduate level, but at the white-collar working level, capturing those career-changers and guide them to making real impact. Perhaps there can be organizations that group ex-bankers and ex-consultants together to create businesses, to consult non-profits, and to sit in workshops to discuss how to find the meaning of life through exploration and self-actualization. Whatever the solution may be, the problem isn’t going away any time soon - especially not in this economy.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[So I stayed up almost all night watching Pirates of Silicon Valley. It’s a docudrama aired in 1999 about the founding of Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corporation. [caption id=”attachment_321” align=”aligncenter” width=”214” caption=”Featuring Bill Gates the Nerd and Steve Jobs the Egomaniac”][/caption] I must admit, even for a non-computer science major, I knew too little about Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Probably because the dominant assumption is that they made their wealth back in the 80’s as personal computers took the world, and the computer/software/OS train has gone too far for our generation to catch its tail. That and the fact that I’m stuck at Columbia where the highest career aspirations are becoming bankers and consultants. But as we are all graduating and trying to figure out where we’re headed, a documented display of how the two walked their paths from nobody to Forbes top 50 sheds light on a few things. The friendly competition between Gates and Jobs is prevalent in most of our worlds - our classmates, our best friends, our frenemies. Like it or not, we are all competitive. We all like to check out how other people are doing and benchmark ourselves to see where we’re at. But that’s good and bad. Sure, it gets us going and injects a fair dosage of motivation every time we fall behind, but it only motivates us to do whatother people are already doing. And here I thought: That would be a big problem if one wants to be original and create something. Right? Not so much. At least not according to the film. Jobs basically copied the user interface and mouse ideas from Xerox to create the Macintosh, and Gates pulled the exact same trick on Jobs and copied the Macintosh to create Windows. So are these two men great visionaries? Or are they just great copiers? I can’t decide. Was it their ambition to take the world that got them where they are? Or was it their creative ideas? [caption id=”attachment_316” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”Without these two, you wouldn&#039;t be seeing any of this right now.”][/caption] Society wants to extol creativity because in our minds, creativity is a virtue. Theft is not. But ideas aren’t worth a dime if there’s no one to take it to the next level. The tricky part is: Who gets a cut out of the deal. Perhaps that’s where the more recent entrepreneurs, the Mark Zuckerberg‘s of the world, are encountering many more difficulties, because this generation has learned the lessons of Jobs and Gates, and will not walk until they’ve put up a serious fight. &nbsp;]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[Closing Up the Gap Year Chapter]]></title>
      <url>%2F2011%2F06%2F16%2Fclosing-up-gap-year%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[The Sentimental Part I took one last look at my comfy bed, wooden floor, coffee table, and picture windows. Two suitcases, one briefcase, ticket in hand booked from Beijing to Hong Kong. Ready? I closed the door. Eight months ago, I took a leap of faith and decided to take a year off from my life as a student. It was the first time that I was not one since kindergarten. Schools are fun, and having been through 10 different schools growing up, I can confidently say that I was not so afraid of switching out yet again to a new environment. People gave me all sorts of reactions to my decision. At first, I cared a lot. My parents were vocally against it, and my closest college friends thought I was doing something terribly stupid. But I was not without support. And looking back, I must thank those that inspired me to take this step. Eight months passed. When I now tell someone that I took a year off, I get lots of questions: “Why did you take a gap year?” Because I wanted to. “What did you do?” A lot. “What did you learn?” A lot more. I wish there was a simple way to describe it all. With words. But words do a terrible job at capturing emotions and self-actualization efficiently. The most I can do is to list out my projects and achievements in a resume-like fashion as if it was an interview. But that’s not the whole story; it’s just the cover, and maybe the table of content. It wasn’t the professional experience from Bain, the leadership experiences from GCC, the cultural experience from Beijing, the philanthropic experience from Heart2Heart, or the entrepreneurial experience from a company I founded with my buddy back at Columbia. It was living the unpackaged life, displacing the self from the support system that it has gotten so used to. It was testing assumptions, be wrong, be right, and formulating a view less breakable, a mind less shakable. It was introspection. How often do you think to yourself, “I’m not like that,” “That’s not who I am,” “That’s not how I do things,” or, “That’s not what I want”? If you think like this pretty often, then congratulations, you seem to know yourself pretty well. For me, these lines didn’t come up often enough throughout my three years of college. True, it was important to keep an open mind, but open-mindedness is hardly self-awareness, and one doesn’t always lead to the next, because too many different experiences at one given time can sometimes confuse you and make you less aware of the self. Exactly one year ago, I was struggling between the idea of becoming an entrepreneur and taking the traditional corporate path. I had trouble deciding if it’s better to make a thousand acquaintances or maintain a dozen close friends. I couldn’t decide if I should dive into China as early as possible before the window of opportunities closes on me, or spend more time in the US to develop myself before doing so. I sometimes relied on the judgment of others because I didn’t trust myself enough. I had a strong desire to take my path to China and reconnect my roots but I didn’t know how. I had a lot to reconcile. In the past eight months, I have done each of these conflicts some justice. I’ve found some valuable insights to these questions - some answered in full, some waiting to be solved. Eight months later, I look into the mirror, and I see someone that I know better. After all, it’s me that I have to deal with for my entire life, and getting to know myself better is probably more useful than knowing anyone else. My Advice I made a few summaries below based on my above-mentioned experiences in China. Hopefully, if you ever decide to take a gap year, you too can discover its magical effects. Beijing/China - The real life doesn’t give out award certificates. No one is obligated to be your friend and to spend his or her precious time with you “hanging out.” Real life is filled with individuals who are pragmatic, materialistic, and pretentious; and most people have got an agenda of some sort behind his or her actions. Useless relationships die after one meal; useful relationships rekindle even after months-long gaps. This is true whether you’re talking to entry-level employees or attending a high-profile networking cocktail watching corporate executives do their dances. (Students, fortunately, may be the only exception here.) Beijing is a tough place to be. It focuses the many desires of China into a tip so sharp that you can sense it in the directness of how people approach you for things. Local Chinese don’t get paid very well, so in order to make it some day they must do what it takes - sometimes things that would be considered unethical in the West. Office politics are layered in matrices of personal relationships. Sentences can be delivered in ten ways but interpreted in twenty. Thinking too much is better than thinking not enough. And _never _trust someone that you can’t verify through another friend. Age/淡定 - As students we honestly don’t think much about age. We are in a system called “school” which places us in the right places at the right age. But in the real world these restrictions are looser. How old are you? How old do people think you are? How old would you like to be? How old would you need to be? But really, how old can you be? Sometimes you are at the right place at the right time, but you might be at the wrong age. In the West, youth is good. Youth is energy, opportunities, and possibilities. But in China, youth is immaturity. It equates to inexperience, which to most people screams unreliability (i.e. 不靠谱). We often think of discrimination in terms of gender, race, and other common distinctions. But age is just as key, and twice as severe in a country that has a hierarchical system by age. What I’m trying to say is this: Don’t let age limit you, but also don’t misperceive your own mental age. At what age does one find oneself exactly? Maybe one never does. But with age, you acquire a sense of 淡定. The nirvana stage of life. The moment when you have gained full control of the self. Management Consulting - Mergers&amp;Inquisitions posted an excellent article about PE in China a few weeks ago. I would borrow the general idea from there and say that the difference between working for MBB in developed markets vs. their emerging market offices is just huge. I was talking to a friend who is working at the McKinsey New York office and was told that he never had trouble finding market segment data about the industries that he was covering. They just email the research department and open Outlook the next morning - and voila! Well, the bad news is, data mining is virtually the bulk of your work in China as an intern in consulting. Industry data don’t really exist because there is not a developed set of research companies that gather these data and make profits off them - asking Chinese companies to pay for data is like asking Chinese college students to pay for .mp3 music. So instead of buying it from someone, you hire cheap labour (i.e. The PTAs) and have them find the data for you via all possible methods. (I’ll leave the methods to your imagination. And you can think of the reliability of the data given those methods.) Purpose/Meaning of Life - I would be megalomaniac if I think that I can somehow explain the meaning of life. But the general idea here is to find it. Something. Anything. The problem with most college grads is that once one has reached the college level (or grad school for that matter - once one has finished one’s education), one is lost. One gets a job. One meets a boy/girl. One marries, has kids, and realizes it’s too late to change careers because the opportunity costs are too high. So we all know how serious it is to take the right step right now. Without going any deeper and making this whole post about the meaning of life altogether, I want to say that whatever you do, do it for a virtuous purpose. Virtuous is the keyword here. Money, fame, bottles-and-models, are not virtuous purposes. Honor (not fame), pride (not ego), and the well-beings of others (family, friends, even strangers) are. The Resume Version Below, I decided to list out the milestones of this past eight months, with pictures and videos, to demonstrate that, no, I did not just waste time in China to 混. I did many things that I would’ve never been able to do without spending those eight months in Beijing. (The external photos are all linked to Picasa, so feel free to contact me if you cannot get access.) So really, what did I do? October 2010 - Tsinghua University - Enrolled in an adult education program about Chinese capital markets and how SMEs can capture these opportunities. October 2010 - Began working at Bain &amp; Co. as a Part-Time Assistant. November 2010 - Finished settling down in Beijing and began helping out GCC China Affairs Division. Arranged a series of meetings with potential partners/sponsors for GCC in Beijing (GCC website).

But with age, you acquire a sense of 淡定. The nirvana stage of life. The moment when you have gained full control of the self. Management Consulting - Mergers&amp;Inquisitions posted an excellent article about PE in China a few weeks ago. I would borrow the general idea from there and say that the difference between working for MBB in developed markets vs. their emerging market offices is just huge. I was talking to a friend who is working at the McKinsey New York office and was told that he never had trouble finding market segment data about the industries that he was covering. They just email the research department and open Outlook the next morning - and voila! Well, the bad news is, data mining is virtually the bulk of your work in China as an intern in consulting. Industry data don’t really exist because there is not a developed set of research companies that gather these data and make profits off them - asking Chinese companies to pay for data is like asking Chinese college students to pay for .mp3 music. So instead of buying it from someone, you hire cheap labour (i.e. The PTAs) and have them find the data for you via all possible methods. (I’ll leave the methods to your imagination. And you can think of the reliability of the data given those methods.) Purpose/Meaning of Life - I would be megalomaniac if I think that I can somehow explain the meaning of life. But the general idea here is to find it. Something. Anything. The problem with most college grads is that once one has reached the college level (or grad school for that matter - once one has finished one’s education), one is lost. One gets a job. One meets a boy/girl. One marries, has kids, and realizes it’s too late to change careers because the opportunity costs are too high. So we all know how serious it is to take the right step right now. Without going any deeper and making this whole post about the meaning of life altogether, I want to say that whatever you do, do it for a virtuous purpose. Virtuous is the keyword here. Money, fame, bottles-and-models, are not virtuous purposes. Honor (not fame), pride (not ego), and the well-beings of others (family, friends, even strangers) are. The Resume Version Below, I decided to list out the milestones of this past eight months, with pictures and videos, to demonstrate that, no, I did not just waste time in China to 混. I did many things that I would’ve never been able to do without spending those eight months in Beijing. (The external photos are all linked to Picasa, so feel free to contact me if you cannot get access.) So really, what did I do? October 2010 - Tsinghua University - Enrolled in an adult education program about Chinese capital markets and how SMEs can capture these opportunities. October 2010 - Began working at Bain &amp; Co. as a Part-Time Assistant. November 2010 - Finished settling down in Beijing and began helping out GCC China Affairs Division. Arranged a series of meetings with potential partners/sponsors for GCC in Beijing (GCC website).

      <url>%2F2011%2F04%2F01%2Fcolumbia-college-admit-rate-drops-to-6-4-percent-why%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Update: Wenyi Zhou, my fellow colleague from GCC who is going to attend Columbia this fall, pointed out a few points that I missed in this post: One other show that made an impact in terms of New York’s popular culture is “How I Met Your Mother”; 2010 is the year when CU started to use Common Application, and rose to #4 on US News Best National University Ranking. Wenyi made some good points - my bad. I guess Columbia did get better by US News World Report standard. And switching over to the common application definitely gets you more applicants - only marginal effort to apply to one more college, why not? Original Post: So I started reading on 各种 Facebook status today that “Columbia College admissions rate drops to 6.4%…” It’s all over the internet as well: http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2011/03/30/cc-admit-rate-drops-64-percent http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/03/31/sorry-seniors-college-admission-rates-are-down-this-year/ To us Columbians, this small, insignificant number represents pride, honor, and _bragging rights _more than anything else. We keep an eye on it like macro traders keep an eye on the Fed funds rate. So Columbia beats everyone except Harvard for “competitiveness” - 6.4% vs. 6.2% of Harvard College. What happened to Yale, Princeton, Stanford? To me, these record low numbers represent two things: Implication Number One: The world is getting more competitive every day. The truth is usually ugly. My grandparents stayed with me a few weeks back and went on and on about how I don’t sleep enough, how I can’t treat my body like this, how I need to take my health seriously, etc. etc. But really, I’m not the only one who’s hard at work here - everyone else is as well. In less than two decades, there will be more Chinese speaking English than the whole population of the United States. People are learning and advancing, and there is nothing to stop that the world from progressing exponentially. The truth is, we are working 10x+ more efficiently than our parents, and maybe producing 100x more content, intellectual property, innovation, ideas, designs, and other forms of “work” than our parents did when they were in their 20’s because we work longer hours (counting my blogging time now as “working” for instance). Implication Number Two: Gossip Girl and Sex and the City are making an impact on college decisions. Students don’t just want a good education no more. They want a good lifestyle too. Living in Philly just won’t cut it. Princeton is for old people. New Haven? Forget it. Maybe West Coast, but that costs a lot. And you need to get a car. It’s the Empire State. New York may longer be the engine of economic growth, but it has become the symbol of luxury, sex, diversity, wealth, freedom, liberty, and just pure awesomeness. Wanna get away from home? New York. Wanna find a job? New York. Wanna have a good time? New York. Wanna sound baller when people ask you “where are you from” and say “New York”? … New York. So naturally, “Columbia University in the City of New York” appears to be a sound value proposition when a college senior from Tennessee glances through the brochures of the top US schools. Ever wonder why Columbia calls itself a name that long? Now you do. In all seriousness, summing up one and two, what New York has that no other city in the US can offer is simply opportunities. Students are engaging with the outside world at an earlier age than they ever before. Take Global China Connection for example - I’ve seen 3-4 people taking a gap year in the middle of our academic studies to spend in China. Students are getting internships between classes to get a head start on their careers. They are attending events to network with professionals to get themselves a foot in the door for a future internship or job. In a difficult job market that’s getting more competitive, this can be your winning strategy. And there is no better place to do a part-time internship or attend a big event than Manhattan.]]></content>

      <url>%2F2011%2F03%2F11%2Fmy-comments-on-a-wharton-professors-view-on-the-brightest-chinese-students%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Below is a comment from Forbes.com that a friend of mine posted on Renren. As someone who is struggling to decide where his life should head post-college, and when to wrap up his US education and begin his China career, I felt that this article really touched on something that all of us college grads (or soon-to-be college grads anyway) have probably thought about. I’ve written a few thoughts below as well: Commentary Chinese Students Want To Know: How Do I Get Rich?Eric K. Clemons, 03.02.09, 12:00 AM ESTA business school professor asks himself what he hath wrought. In February, three Wharton faculty colleagues and I had the pleasure of dining with 19 visiting students from one of China’s most prestigious universities. The students were young. They were charming. They were very intelligent. And they were very, very goal-directed. My colleagues and I had each prepared brief opening remarks, but the students were having none of it. They had elected a delegation leader, and the delegation leader, as quickly as possible, got to the question the students all wanted to address: What are the implications of the current financial and economic crisis? A colleague in the accounting department gave them a careful, scholarly, even-handed explanation of how firms’ decisions on the repricing of assets in their portfolio could perhaps have been used, perhaps unintentionally, to create false expectations in the marketplace, and could have been done in a way undetectable to auditors, leading to over-investment in toxic subprime assets. No, that’s not what the students wanted to discuss. With much less tact, I explained that, indeed, mispricing of assets at an inflated price could have been deliberately used to create the illusion of value, and this could then have been used to create the very real rewards of wealth for the financial engineering wizards responsible for the scheme. This got us much closer to the questions that the visiting students wanted to address. Their first round of questions were basically, How can I get that job? How can I get a high-paying job in investment banking now? My colleagues and I attempted to convince them that those jobs simply will not exist again, at historical levels of compensation, in the months or years before these students’ graduation. This led to a second round of questions, like, What can I do while working as a desk drone in an audit firm in China to ensure that I can get into Wharton, Harvard or Stanford, and get a job in investment banking later? The students were patient. They did not need a job with a $10 million bonus now, as long as the prospect of receiving it later would still arise. I then suggested that perhaps they might work for companies that made things. Actual things. With a burgeoning middle class that would soon be larger than the entire population of the U.S. or Western Europe, surely there was going to be a huge domestic market for things in China. The students could pursue careers with companies that were working to develop and to sell appliances fit for a Chinese home, or mass-market, branded consumer package goods for the new middle class Chinese consumer. This was met with stares from the students. Another colleague from the management department suggested that Chinese retailing and distribution offered two other growth opportunities for a bold young entrepreneur. Again, we got mostly stares. I then explained that there are really only three ways for an individual to earn tens of millions of dollars a year: –Create a company that creates real wealth and keep a piece of the company. Bill Gates did that at Microsoft (nasdaq: MSFT - news - people ), and he is, probably, still one of the five wealthiest men in America. Vanderbilt (railroads and shipping), Carnegie (U.S. Steel (nyse: X - news - people )) and Rockefeller (Standard Oil) did it, too. These men played hardball, seeking to crush commercial competitors, but they did successfully transform America and the world. –Facilitate the creation of real wealth by others and keep a piece of each transaction. J. P. Morgan convinced European investors that they would earn far more investing in the fastest-growing industries in the United States than they would investing in their more developed, more mature and more slowly growing domestic markets. He directed the capital that led to the industrialization of the United States. American industrialists got rich. European investors got rich. America was transformed, and his share of each transaction ensured that Morgan became wealthy as well. Venture capitalists, early round investors in new companies and firms that underwrite their initial public offerings all facilitate the creation of new companies and the creation of jobs and wealth, and profit from it. Early investors in Microsoft, Google (nasdaq: GOOG - news - people ), Oracle (nasdaq: ORCL - news - people ) and Apple (nasdaq: AAPL - news - people ) all profited quite handsomely from it. This used to be the principal function of Wall Street firms other than those principally in retail brokerage. But it produces individual Wall Street executive wealth only slowly, and only when Wall Street produces increases in national wealth. Patient men like Warren Buffett still facilitate wealth creation, and Buffett may be richer even than Gates. –Steal it. Stealing money is much more reliable than earning it. You can steal wealth slowly, the old-fashioned way, buried within the operations of trading for the house account. Or you can steal it quickly, by using obscure and poorly understood financial artifacts to produce the illusion of wealth creation. Then you take a piece of the illusionary wealth, as personal cash, now. Then you exit and duck for cover before the entire game blows up. Better yet, you can sell your private equity firm to naïve investors for one final twist of the knife into the carcass of your nation. (Deliberate fraud, like those allegedly committed by Bernie Madoff or Robert Allen Stanford, is too crude to be of interest to young financial engineers, and too likely to result in extreme punishment.) I then suggested that if students were not interested in earning their money through entrepreneurship (too risky), then investment banking in China offered the next best alternative for personal wealth creation. Facilitating investment in, and growth of, companies catering to the wants, needs, cravings and longings of China’s growing middle class, offers Chinese investment bankers a path toward personal wealth by creating national wealth, much as J. P. Morgan did for America. The students, though, were uninterested in banking in China. After the students left, it took my colleagues and me a couple of hours to figure out why this was so. I-banking in China is about improving China. The students saw i-banking in America as being about improving their own personal wealth, first and foremost; if the client could be assisted without too much personal inconvenience then and only then did they see American i-banking as also being about value creation. I asked myself, What have we done? When I thought that the craze for private equity careers and investment banking careers among the brightest Western students was the fault of Western business schools, I felt both shame (for perhaps having contributed to this) and fear (for how we as a nation could possibly compete with foreign nations where the best and brightest young students sought real careers). Perhaps the fear was unwarranted. Perhaps the best and the brightest students of other nations also wish to transform their homelands from economic dragons into paper tigers, following the Western model. Interestingly, our own students are indeed learning to manage, learning to market, learning operations and production planning and logistics; they are working hard to get ready for a world of things. Perhaps America doesn’t have as much to fear from foreign competition as we thought. Eric K. Clemons is a professor in the Information Strategy and Economics Group at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. My 2 cents: I think between the time stamp on this article and today, there’s been a slight change in sentiment of Chinese students to investment banking careers in China - it’s “cool” now to work for CICC or CITIC. Probably even cooler than working for non-bulge bracket American or European banks. The Chinese always had a thing for prestige. Prestige probably outweigh how much money you’re making, how much time you’re working, how much illegal activities are going on under the table, or any other factor that concerns a job hunter who is Chinese. The same thing applies for college selections. Harvard is the only school worth going to - or so my dad thinks. So CICC and CITIC became “cool” now, because they became prestigious. Working for a domestic Chinese PE firm is “cool” now for the same reason. Prestige comes down to one thing - how we look in the eyes of others. To live a happy and fulfilling life is to live a happy and fulfilling life in the eyes of others. To be rich is to be rich in the eyes of others. To be powerful is to be powerful in the eyes of others. To be, is to be in the eyes of others. This is our generation. A generation of so many Chinese in most places around the world that one finds little space to live outside of the eyes of others. If escaped, one is considered outcast in the eyes of others. One is boxed, and if one is claustrophobic one might wish that one wasn’t born Chinese. Think, if only one had golden locks and blue eyes, one would look “special” in the eyes of the Chinese by default - no further action is necessary. Vain. The excess of this country is sure evident to every single person who can spend more than 100RMB per head on a meal. Because from there you can see the guy who can spend 200RMB, and his friend who can spend 300RMB, and on we go - the sky is the limit. But on second thought, the students in the story who wanted Wall Street investment banking jobs are goal-oriented and direct because they cared to visit Wharton. The bright students of Tsinghua or PKU or any other academic institutions in China who are not interested in Wall Street investment banking jobs probably don’t even know what Wharton is. They probably won’t pay thousands of dollars to go to the US to meet bankers. They would be visiting labs and research centers in places like MIT, Stanford, Silicon Valley. On sponsored money. The best and the brightest of this country don’t all want investment banking jobs on Wall Street. But if they are spending years in the lab or doing grass-root NGO work they need to still make a living. It should be the government’s job to make sure that the best and the brightest can afford building the society by creating real things. CSR can help with that as well. &nbsp;]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[My View on Online vs. Print Media]]></title>
      <url>%2F2011%2F03%2F01%2Fmy-view-on-online-vs-print-media%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Ever since I became a Kindle user a few months ago, I’ve developed a few thoughts on the effect of e-books on traditional print media. The general effect is quite apparent to most: E-books make print media much less desirable. In my view, there are two main trends that are the key drivers for this shift:1. The Internet:There’s been a steady movement from print media to online media in general over the past decade. Printing was no longer the ONLY way of making content available, and more and more content are being published online. People are using computers more and more to access information, replacing reading books/magazines/newspapers, watching TV, even talking to people, etc. All of one’s information-gathering experience can be moved to the computer in a centralized fashion. As access to computers become easier, fewer people rely on print media for information. Simply put, we’ve got options.2. The Mobile Devices:There’s been a boom in the number of mobile devices that allow for access to e-books. Technology (think the iPhone, Amazon Kindle, and other mobile devices) are allowing people access to content without physically being in front of a computer. This means even less of a demand for print media. Cell phone screens are getting better, new display technology is allowing for better reading experiences, battery life is lasting longer, and distribution networks are becoming more established (like the iTunes store or the Amazon book store that can wirelessly deliver books/newspapers/magazines/blogs to the reading devices). This means that those people who could not be in front of a computer all the time can now access all that information wirelessly on a mobile device. This means that the ONLY competitive advantage that print media once had over online media - mobility - is also gone.Other, smaller factors:3. Save paper:A small, but complimentary factor is that companies and corporations are called on by activists to go “green” and save paper. The global “green” movement means that things that people used to get in paper (delivery of bills, advertisement, coupons to shop at local stores, etc.) are also being taken online. Fewer people check their mails daily, because most of what you can get in a mail are being moved to the virtual space to save paper.4. The social factorSocial networks like Facebook, Twitter, Renren, Sina microblog, are allowing people to gather information and give instant feedback to demonstrate personality and identity to others. Would you rather read a funny article and laugh to yourself and then forget about it, or would you rather post it on your Renren and Twitter and have your friends (or “fans”) comment on it? The result can be that you feel like a more popular and interesting person. This social experience makes online media irreplaceable by print media. Yes, and vanity sells.5. IP protectionThe biggest problem with online media was intellectual property protection - how do you stop someone from sharing your content somewhere else? This is one big reason why the New York Times and Wall Street Journal changed over to paid online subscription instead of free content. Yes, you can get the same news everywhere, but you only get the fastest and most reliable news by subscribing to the most well-known news sources. Also, if books, magazines, etc. are now offered on the iTunes store and Amazon book store, publishers are more likely to go to them for distribution because their IP are protected (for example, you can’t just buy a book on the Kindle and send it to someone else’s computer).So another question to consider would be this: Will print media ever disappear? Probably not.1. Secure storage - you can lose all your data on the computer, but you are less likely to lose a book because internet viruses can’t eat paper.2. Physical/historic value - the author can sign his/her book, but can’t sign the e-book. A collector might have a room full of Japanese cartoons, but you if it’s all digital in a harddrive then it’s probably worth nothing.Although e-books are seriously hurting the businesses relying on print media, the trend will create more opportunities for online distributors, IT companies, mobile device manufacturers, and smaller publishers (since it’s now much cheaper to publish something online). Print media will still have a place, just a much smaller one. Fewer jobs in the print factory, but more jobs in the IT and journalism areas. This is a good trend, and one that will create a better digital information experience for readers worldwide.Now let’s all get Kindles =).]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Sometimes, one gets lucky in life. So I met my hero two nights ago at the Sina 2010 Internet Celebration (新浪2010·网络盛典). There were lots of big-name people there, and it really convinced me of 1. Sina’s dominant power in China’s media sphere and 2. The future market of the micro-blogging sector in China. This event was able to attract many celebrities, many of whom you can find at the link above, but it was also able to attract the some of the most prominent business figures in China today: 任志强，潘石屹，李开复，曹国伟，周忻，张亚勤，冯军，etc. I was, and by no means I’m I trying to exaggerate, starstruck. &nbsp; [caption id=”attachment_191” align=”aligncenter” width=”614” caption=”Meeting my hero Jack Ma”][/caption] I think of all businessmen in China, I wanted to meet Jack Ma the most. He is to me beyond a businessman, celebrity, CEO, founder, or anything else that you can put a tangible name on. He embodies an era that is going through China’s rapidly-growing economy and a culture that is being pioneered in China at this very moment - the culture of entrepreneurship and innovation. Words can’t describe how excited I was when I shook his hand and told him about GCC and the work that we are doing. I of course extended a friendly invite for his son, who now attends my high school, to join GCC when he begins his studies in college. I told him about how we attended the Alifest this year and our great meeting with Ambassador Huntsman. He nodded and smiled haha. I like Jack, and will probably continue to like and respect him for as long as Alibaba continues to make meaningful contribution to the Chinese society. I was not there to take pictures with as many famous people as I can so, here ends my sharing of photos with me in it. But below are some interesting photos I thought might catch one’s sight: &nbsp; [caption id=”attachment_194” align=”aligncenter” width=”614” caption=”任志强和潘石屹“纺织围脖””][/caption] &nbsp; [caption id=”attachment_192” align=”aligncenter” width=”576” caption=”姚晨上台领奖”][/caption] &nbsp; [caption id=”attachment_193” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”方文山上台颁奖”][/caption] &nbsp; So in the end I saw 方文山 haha. This was great. A night I will remember forever :-). &nbsp;]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Update 4:38pm - Today was a tough day. But in the end, I believe I came out victorious. Because on my passport now is a multi-entry visa to PRC for the next - wait for it… TWO YEARS! Can’t get that in Hong Kong. Or many other places. Not on the same day anyway. What this means is no more visa issues for the next 730 days. That’s 17,520 hours or about one million minutes. That’s how long I will NOT have to think about the word “visa” again. Good-bye Malaysia, maybe it ain’t so bad here after all. At least you took care of my visa =). – Update 1:04pm - I did mention it was war… and I didn’t give up that easy. Found a ticket on AirAsia.com for 8:30pm. Flying to Guangzhou for the night and taking the first flight tomorrow morning to Sanya. Missing out tonight, but catching most of tomorrow. Let me out of KL!!! – Update 12:15pm - I might’ve been a little too happy little too early. Turns out there are no flights from Kuala Lumpur to Sanya (to Guangzhou actually, for transit) after 2:10pm. When I pick up my passport at 3:30pm the flight will be hovering over Hainan, looking down at Sanya, ridiculing my stupidity. The flight still has to land in Guangzhou before another flight takes over to fly to Sanya. Sanya - you suck. Why do no one want to fly to you? Must not be very popular. So yah. I am stuck in Malaysia. The war has been fought and lost. Booking a hotel now and flights for tomorrow. I miss non-traveling. – Update 11:08am - Successfully submitted my application in time for Rush Service! The process was quite painful. A bit of sharing here for any of you who might run into this problem down the line. So I just walked in there with my passport and basically nothing else. I had to get my photos taken, cost 16 ringgit (about 40RMB), then photocopy the picture page of my passport as well as the page with the Malaysian entry stamp - 40 sen (cents) for the two pages. There was no line. It’s a big air-conditioned room with very few people in there. I guess Malaysians all got their multi-entry visa already and aren’t really thinking about getting new ones in early January. Most of the workers are Malaysians who speak Chinese. I was quick. Like all other consulates you pay when you pick-up the visa. Mine’s supposed to be done at 3:30pm (they close at 4:00pm). Keeping my fingers crossed that this is happening. – So I was playing clever and tricked myself into thinking that I can magically get a Chinese visa when I land in Sanya around 5:30pm today. Wrong. All flights from Kuala Lumpur to Sanya must transfer through Guangzhou, and you get out of the boarder in Guangzhou - and there is no visa for you, or your fellow travelers, or anybody else, waiting in Guangzhou. So I’m now on the KLIA Ekspress (Kuala Lumpur International Airport “Express”) heading back into the city to the Chinese embassy to get my visa. The website says that “rushed service” is available and you can obtain your visa in the afternoon on the same day, provided that you submit the application sufficiently early. Today is Friday - so if I miss this, I am stuck here for the weekend. Wasted my hotel fees in Sanya and have to pay more for the hotel here in KL. Can’t meet up with the four friends I planned to meet with in Sanya at this event I’ve been so excited about. Three giant capital letters hover above my head as I type away here on this air-conditioned, internet-infused, bad-music-playing train. The first letter comes immediately after E, the second after L, and the third one after K. Does this justify my escapist longing for Beijing right now? … Probably yes. This reminds me of my last trip in HK where I also almost didn’t get a visa in time to return to China - well, this time because my passport pages were running out and the 中国旅行社 won’t submit my visa for me. I went to the consulate myself and nobody said anything about the fact that I had only one page left in my passport. This experience of course prompted me to get a new passport with twice as many pages as my previous one (who’d known in 2008 that I’d be traveling so much?). Alrighties, train rolling into the city. Updates coming. Wish me luck. Fingers crossed.]]></content>

      <url>%2F2010%2F12%2F31%2Fheart2heart-one-more-time-one-last-time%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[From Dec. 27th – Dec. 30th began my first few days of a winter travel plan that will conclude on Jan. 11th when I return to Beijing. Flew down from Beijing to Shenzhen on the 27th, checked in at the hotel and quickly went through some GCC e-mails to hand off some responsibilities while I’m away. Then ensued the birthday festival that has become a tradition for one of my best friends in life. To me, it was a high school reunion, a networking party, and a vacation – a beautiful all-in-one package. [caption id=”attachment_170” align=”aligncenter” width=”819” caption=”Beach @ 大梅沙”][/caption] [caption id=”attachment_171” align=”aligncenter” width=”819” caption=”Marco + I. Going back a long time.”][/caption] &nbsp; [caption id=”attachment_169” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”The reunion. Good days back in Vancouver.”][/caption] &nbsp; The following morning began at 4:59am, when I sat an alarm to wake myself. I had left the balcony doors open when I went to sleep. The waves were still going, the night still dark. We hopped into a car and sped toward Guangzhou airport, where we were to take an 8am flight to Guiyang, Guizhou, China. [caption id=”attachment_172” align=”aligncenter” width=”717” caption=”@ Guangzhou Airport ready to fly off to Guizhou.”][/caption] &nbsp; This was my third time visiting this same exact location where Heart2Heart built its first-ever school. We had ambitious plans. The plan was executed. And here we were, in front of a two-story brick building, of 60-70 children who have gone to or current go to the school, of the parents, the townsmen, and the government officials who have worked together to make a lofty goal of some high school students a reality. [caption id=”attachment_179” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”Guizhou. One more time.”][/caption] [caption id=”attachment_176” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”We were asked to say a few words. We tried to make it fun.”][/caption] [caption id=”attachment_174” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”Re-enacting 2006.”][/caption] [caption id=”attachment_175” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”Bringing a few things for them.”][/caption] [caption id=”attachment_173” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”The kids.”][/caption] [caption id=”attachment_177” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”Playing games with the kids.”][/caption] [caption id=”attachment_178” align=”aligncenter” width=”490” caption=”The town&#039;s senior leaders wanted to join =).”][/caption] I never cried when I saw them before. The children. This time there were children who we’ve seen four years ago. There were parents who we saw four years ago also… but were no longer around. This time I almost, well, cried. I think Marco’s right – because it felt like we weren’t gonna come back. Life is future-bound at light-speed. The transition between the current stage and the next will complete when we have only found out that it has begun. Our lives as students are quickly coming to an end. Upon graduation, we will no longer be who we are today, nor will we act like students ever again. I will remember the conversation we had on the way down the mountain, walking through blocks of stones in the dark of the night, covered by clouds. Life goes on, but with the end of one project comes the beginning of the next. When we grow older, we will have the power to do bigger – that which will bring bigger changes to this world than education opportunities for the children of one village on the mountaintop of a small town in the Southwestern part of China. &nbsp; Not that this wasn’t great, but we are simply shooting for more. &nbsp; &nbsp; (My apologies because this post goes back a long way into my high school life. Many gaps to fill between the lines. If you’re interested in the details please check out www.h2hsociety.org + my Facebook photos dating back in 2006-2007. I’ll be posting pictures from this trip when I have more stable Internet access.) (Also, if you’re interested in donating to H2H, let me know as well =).) &nbsp;]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[London Recap - with Pictures]]></title>
      <url>%2F2010%2F11%2F29%2Flondon-recap-with-pictures%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[London To start with, London is damn expensive. Strong pound + high inflation = my poor wallet. A subway ride is 1.8GBP (2.0RMB in Beijing…). A cup of corn is 2 pounds, a waffle is 4.5. Clubbing makes you want to just take the next flight back to Beijing and head straight to Mix. Cover for men is 20 pounds, simplest mixed drinks are 8. Oh, and don’t even think about taking a cab. Airport ⇒ city = 70 pounds. Enough to 包车 for two full days in Beijing. Surprise #2: From Wuhan to Vancouver to New York to Hong Kong to Beijing, I’ve never been to a place that is so class-conscious. It might’ve been too easy for me to classify North America and all of Europe as the “Western World.” Indeed they may be, but much less homogenous than I had anticipated. Social class definitely exists, in a way that’s much more visible than it is in the US or China. Realization: Over here in London, I wholeheartedly felt what Adam Smith meant by “scarcity of resources,” and why mercantilism made so much sense for a naval power. Cuz this place is tiny! When each has too little, you take it from the outside; when there are too many of you and not enough coming in from the outside, you send them off to the outside. The royalty had places like the Buckingham Palace, the rich had the small houses and the poor had nothing. If I were standing here 200 years ago, immigration to the United States just made so much sense. Why after being in London at the bottom I’d think a two-acre plot in the middle of nowhere in Wisconsin would be the best thing in the world. It comes glazed with sunshine too! The pictures below are misleading - it was sunny for only 2/8 days I was there, which’s why I took so many photos on those two days =P. Just Photoshop the pictures below wherever you see skyblue - just replace it with gray and you’ll get London on a normal day. [caption id=”” align=”alignnone” width=”766” caption=”London - an expensive living.”][/caption] Oxbridge It would have been an honor to study here. Perhaps. Perhaps too much of an honor. Those were my thoughts when I toured through Oxford and Cambridge, college after college. The buildings that made up the college campus were breathe-taking… only too literally. I could feel my heartbeat – it was some pressure just by standing there and absorbing the landscape – every atom was filled with history, and I, by simply standing there, was intruding with my Panasonic camera, cotton sweater, denim jeans, and non-royal blood and perhaps the wrong eye color. I took a picture in front of King’s College to play on the fact that Columbia was once named such. But thinking back to my days of entering into Columbia, I felt welcomed. Here, I felt… not so welcomed. No, no one told me that I wasn’t. No one would. No one needed to. It was a very natural instinct that you just got like when you just walked into a room where people were discussing private matters – you just knew. [caption id=”” align=”alignnone” width=”912” caption=”Oxbridge - apparently much cheaper than the Ivy League”][/caption] There was this girl, playing the piano inside of that chapel (picture on the very left). The chapel was gorgeous – spot-lighted at all the right places, furnished with dark wooden benches, and the sound, oh the sound, it was the sort of thing you could only see and hear in movies, because quite honestly, there is nowhere else in the world the can replicate this stuff. This stuff was legit beyond reason. This stuff was as authentic as it gets. At St. George’s, where I attended high school, we had a chapel too. Only it just wasn’t legit. The lighting, the walls, the images, the piano, even the air – it wasn’t authentic. Comparing it to this, the St. George’s version seemed more mockery than imitation. That’s how bad it was. At least in my memory. Also, we hosted formal dinners weekly, and I sat next to the headmaster on the head table. But no, it wasn’t the same. Sure, it felt good, but looking at the dining hall of the Oxford colleges, where Harry Potter was filmed, I felt like back in high school we had been having afternoon tea with Styrofoam cups and Lipton all along, but here in this hall, at Oxford, you’d be sipping Earl Grey in real china. Shakespeare’s Globe Of all the wonderful things in the great city of London, I wanted to see this the most. I couldn’t really figure out why, until I sat down inside the wooden bench made out of oak and got slammed by what felt like childhood memories. High school – and alllll five years of it. Whether it was in public or private schools, with great teachers or sorry ones, in Honor-ed or dishonoring English classes, there was one connecting point, one thread of memory just vague enough that you can recall every detail as soon as you hear the first line of evocation: To be or not to be… that is the question. – The omnipresence of Shakespeare in my early academic life. The thing about Shakespeare is that most people didn’t really enjoy reading it. It would’ve been harder than reading a medical textbook. At least with medical terms you can just look them up in a dictionary – with Shakespeare you had to decide between you and the author who actually spoke English. The funnier thing about Shakespeare is that I ended up liking it a lot, and I think some others did too, but none of us wanted to admit it, at least not in a very open, outright sort of way. Not in an all-boy boarding school where rugby was the subject of the daily athletics sermon. [caption id=”” align=”alignnone” width=”912” caption=”Shakespeare&#039;s Globe - it&#039;s like a pilgrimage.”][/caption] Digging a little deeper, I think I’ve figured out why Shakespeare created such a strong impression in my mind – when studying his works, we did everything to make the stuff real. We read out loud and acted the stuff out in class; we watched videos and listened to recordings; we attended shows and saw the pros do it in real life, in costumes of different eras; we even had comic books on it. We then repeat this process every year for five years. Now how can you NOT remember his stuff? The power of propaganda. The psychological intrusion of inception. I like Shakespeare. If only Shakespeare were Canadian I’d now have now be more loyal to the maple leaf than I am to the queen. But the fascinating thing is that, what they did for Shakespeare, they did for French too. I took three/four years of French and there were plenty of videos and funny-looking faces trying to teach us how to speak/read/write Canada’s second official language. But I never got interested… No offence to the language or anything, I think it’s the system’s problem. So here’s where I figured out that Shakespeare had real value – he taught us about love, hate, treason, life and death. French classes taught us numbers, colors, dates, orangina and croissant. Having studied A Mid-Summer Night’s Dream, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, King Leer, and Hamlet… I apparently have read more Shakespeare than some of the Brits! How very proud I am now of my Canadian schooling system. The Chinese should model after this for 国学. Summary This trip reaffirmed my desire to stay in, or around, China. Britain is supposed to be one of the most advanced European countries running one of Europe’s best economies, but what I saw was more than uninspiring – at least for me, a Chinese person, or a person from the Far East as they would call it. The most concerning factor in Europe is their human capital. Labor utilization rate and productivity. In simpler terms, how long people work for and how efficient do they work. Both, in my humble opinion, have a lot to do with culture. In other words, there’s no simple, short-term fix for this, because culture doesn’t just change overnight. Both, in my humble opinion, put China in the escalator going up and Europe on the elevator going down. Once again, I felt an in-depth pride for being Chinese. Work hard, play harder, make bank. None of which shall take place in the great city of London, unfortunately. Maybe for an authentic meal + afternoon tea ;) [caption id=”” align=”alignnone” width=”912” caption=”Food, glorious food…”][/caption] Special shoutouts to my dear friends who showed us around and took care of us: Yihui Zhang + suitemate Amanda, Boin Cheong @ Cambridge, and Doris (GCC) and Alpha @ Oxford! Hope to see you guys back in Asia soon!]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Of all my whimsical decisions in life - and there haven’t been many, really, not even the great Gap Year - this one probably is sitting near the top of the list: I am in London.(Yes, I am that unexciting). The 11-hour flight on British Airways from Beijing to London was delayed by an hour due to - surprise - 航空管制. Flight was great. Food sucked. Didn’t watch their movies because after all British Airways ain’t no Cathay Pacific. Met a fellow Chinese person who now works in Edinburgh. And we talked for quite a bit about… GCC. How sad. Well we talked more than just about GCC, but I’ve learned that it creates more of an impression than talking about Goldman Sachs. (Can someone in GCC pay me for saying this?) No actually we began by talking about the iPad and how to jailbreak it (Apple is more likely to pay me than GCC so… oh wait, I mentioned jailbreaking…). Anyhow, sitting in the airport and taking a minute to collect myself: Pounds + SIM card + phone numbers = Functional human being. Meeting up with a friend from GS over the summer later. It’s amazing how this airport alone left me with such a great impression of London. I am that shallow. Wow. Will be up in 12 hours for a GCC conference call at 5am London time. I really feel now like I work for a non-profit organization. Life is good, From Heathrow]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[我在贝恩实习了]]></title>
      <url>%2F2010%2F10%2F16%2Finterning-at-bain-and-co%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[中秋／国庆假期前后，事情发生的太多，进展太快，来不及一一写下。这里简短的来几句概括一下这两天的感想，等回头再回忆假期的事情。 拿到贝恩公司的PTA工作了，非常兴奋的在第一天就从早上10点工作到了凌晨1点。第一个任务：做survey。在东方新天地逮了数个小时的人，愿意做我这份3页纸survey的人真的实在太少。这一下午遭到的拒绝总数就已经超过了我平时一年的总和。 我灵机一动，直奔一个目标人群聚集的街－果然，命中率几乎100％。Easy, I thought. It’s all about finding the right target. 但几个小时之后，我累了。 我终于了解到了survey是多么他妈的难做。在一个陌生人几乎不怎么打招呼的社会里，starting a conversation with a stranger 就像是用手来拨菠萝皮一样－it’s just not meant to be done that way. 找人做survey都怎么难，可想而知推销产品有多难了。在学校bubble中的我们总是把事情想的很容易。还记得，我一开始觉得survey这种东西肯定很容易－you just need persistence. And I can be persistent. Well… turns out it’s a lot harder than it looks. 在东单的一个十字路口的栏杆上依着，我的腿部和脚底都在以疼痛向我抗议。And then it hit me. I have only been walking for about a week (including the days when I spent finding an apartment and moving), and already my legs are getting killed by the vastness of Beijing. 但是和那些站着一天的工作比起来，我的工作简直是天堂。而仔细想想，在这个世界上，站一天的工作要远远多过不站一天的：店员，服务员，工厂工人，工地工人，保安，保姆，阿姨 - basically, probably the majority of what’s deemed to be a “job” in this world requires more standing time than sitting time. There is a difference between this and the feeling you get when witnessing extreme poverty. Extreme poverty tells you that the gap between rich and poor is that between heaven and hell; but this tells you what it means when the world tells you that you are the top 0.001% of the population in terms of income - it means the small difference between how much time you get to sit vs. standing. Or it tells you how weak you are compare to those who can take it. 一个普通的店员，在站了一天后，做地铁，走，买菜，走，回家，做饭，洗碗，洗衣。。。 她还有时间做别的吗？ 一天下来累的想死，发觉原来社会的阶层是可以由时间的多少来决定的。The wealth people don’t stand or walk as much, and thus have more energy to focus on other things. They do not have to cook everyday, or do their own laundry, so thus have more time to do what can create more opportunities for them - client dinners, networking events, making phone calls, building contacts. The difference between rich and poor, in this sense, is not really about not having the right access - it’s more like the lack of time and the energy that can be used during that time to gain those accesses. 我这也算是体验了基层工作吧，只是没想到会是在贝恩 lol.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[(I wrote this at the end of finals last semester when I was done with school and wanted to think of an entrepreneurial idea to start up a company with… again, sharing this quite late =P): Ever been fascinated by how much you can learn in less than a week? Every finals week for me has been an reenactment of the same process leading up to the moment of epiphany - the recognition my own mental capacity. All of a sudden I resurrect as myself at the smartest, the brightest, the most hard-working and tireless state. I am superhuman. Because I just learned a semester worth of crap in less than ten hours. But with the injection of limited dosage of optimism, I should probably look behind myself and realize for how long in the past semester I have been functioning, very much voluntarily and rationally, at limited mental capacity. I have thought about so many things that I would deem as “witty” or “smart” this past week while studying. Ideas, questions, answers, and resolutions that would have been great essay topics, class discussions, or just points of curiosity that I could have learned about by merely approaching the expert within an arm’s reach - the professor. Granted, not every professor is worth reaching out to, but some of them are - Jeffrey Sachs, Ronald Findlay, Perry Mehrling. True, I have forgotten a lot of these random, witty thoughts already. They sneak out of your brain as they squeeze in - instantaneously. I used to keep some of these ideas on my cellphone, a sheet of paper… somewhere. But such habits, as I have learned, unless reinforced by brutality (either self-induced or externally-imposed), is rarely instilled permanently. This time, one thought sticked around because - and only because - I sent it to myself in an e-mail as soon as I thought about it. The thought was about entrepreneurship - because while studying, I was wondering why, if I was in fact smart, was I not able to come up with a goddamn creative million-dollar idea?? And here it is… (the thought, not the million-dollar idea. Sorry.) I was studying for music hum, during which I listened to the same 50 songs over and over again for 5 hours (don’t need to study much for music hum… but the songs sticked around much longer… they sticked around for days, and I remember writing a Corporate Finance exam while Schoenberg was playing in my head - not a pleasant experience), and I thought about the difference between innovation in art vs. innovation in business. Art is driven by personal desire to innovate, to create something that detracts from the mainstream - because in many cases the best way to become famous is to be different. Art can go anywhere - there is really no boundaries to it. Entrepreneurial innovation is different in that it is driven by the newly developed wants and needs in existence in this earthly world. Sure, you can argue that art can sometimes be a reaction to certain earthly changes (e.g. the French Revolution and how it transformed Romanticism), but that is what remains popular/mainstream. The point is that art can also be done on the anti-popular and anti-mainstream side - but entrepreneurial creations cannot. Entrepreneurial innovations by nature MUST be popular and mainstream - or else who’s gonna buy your crap??? So in summary, it appears as if it is hard to be an entrepreneur because you have to think along side with consumers and innovate in line with what is already accepted. On the contrary, artists can just do whatever the hell has not been done before, using various media and, voila, the next masterpiece. So I’ve solved for myself why coming up with the next million-dollar idea is going to be slightly tougher than the next artistic masterpiece. Still, I’m a big believer in that necessity drives innovation. If we all went bankrupt today and had to think of something to make money, or if our GPA was all of a sudden tied up to how great an entrepreneurial idea we can come up with, I’m sure all the college students would use a lot more of the creativity that they possess to come up with ideas. Given how we can learn a semester of work in a week (and therefore a whole school year worth of work in 14 days), I’m sure coming up with a million-dollar idea won’t be hard.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[这是在青海旅游的时候在手机上写的，现在才移到电脑上，分享一下：座落在山脉底部的藏民小屋，前方是海拔五千米的雪山峰，奔赴黄河的急流，两旁是弯曲的道路，和一群群在草地上行走、奔跑、跳跃、拉屎的羊群。沉默的牦牛站在道路的另一边，用威武的站姿守护着身边嬉戏的小牦牛，嘴里时不时还嚼着草。夜晚，疲惫地回到屋中，热情的藏民早已准备了丰盛的晚餐。一斤羊肉和二两二锅头下肚后，躺在两床巨厚的军棉被中间的我，望着窗外那十五的月亮，圆过更亮过所有记忆中月亮的长相。一个星期以前，我还在香港。我在办公室和酒店之间跑了n个来回，吃了好似无数次的叉烧饭，喝了好似无数杯的冻柠茶，落佐好似无数次的LKF，为了一个很简而易懂的目标奋斗。跟一些朋友喝酒聊天，说到每星期要工作八十个小时，他们说好辛苦。 苦吗？什么苦？为什么我觉得这不算苦？我想问，我们这一代人懂得什么叫做“苦”吗？我自问从小衣食饱满，从没饿过肚子，从没在不自愿的情况下干过苦力活，从没有过身体上的过分痛苦。可我的父辈呢，三年自然灾害差点饿死，文革下放就不用多说了，回城后胃病两年做了六次胃镜吃了百来副中药，年轻时学校经常打架，创业后失败n次但每一次都爬起来再来，一生中大起大落，从未言苦。是，时代不一样了，现在如果想去吃那时的苦可以说是脑袋进水，吃了也是白吃。但是就算是每星期工作一百个小时，我们的“苦”也是不一样的。能够承受及面对我们无法改变的现实，在收到精神上的极端考验下挺过来，那才是能吃苦。我们父辈的苦，是没有选择的苦。我们这一代人，大部分不但有选择，而且有很多选择。这个时代，吃苦的机会太少了，因为逃避的机会太多了。选择给我们带来了不必要的解脱，让我们可以沿着社会的传送带到达一个适合我们舒适生活的地方。唯有野心和抱负可以支配我们不要停在平庸的现状，要走的更远。在山里放牛的牧民人，他们苦吗？只要他们不需要更好的，更多的，他们就不苦，他们很快乐。在有选择的时代中，有欲望才有苦。在没有选择的时代中的那种为饱暖所吃的苦，可能已经很难寻找了。]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[“That’s so cool!” is usually the first reaction I receive when I entrust someone with my idea of taking a gap year. “So what are you gonna do?” is usually the sentence immediately following that. To be perfectly honest here for a second before returning to my full-on 忽悠 mode: I don’t know. … Entrepreneurship? … Management consulting? … Finance?? Ten weeks in finance. I witness the S&amp;P fall to its regional low of 1,022, its correction back to around 1,120 on the back of strong 2Q earnings, and then its dip back down when bank after bank began downgrading economic forecasts of both the emerging markets and OECD. Economics aside, I learned a lot about not so much investments, but rather investor mentalities. On our portfolio trading simulation team, no one knew which stock was going to make us money. We made bets on Visa, on Amazon, on tech ETFs, but no one knew. Ten weeks may have allowed me to skim the surface of some fundamental and technical analyses, but really, I’m barely skimming the surface and I already see how deep the water must be. No one who has the money in the pool is going to stay calm and undisturbed when thousands and thousands of market news cross-pollinate to create a jungle of uncertainty. The incentive structure of the information distribution system in the investment world is skewed up and to the right. Good times everyone makes money, bad times no one talks and the floor contains as much noise as the inside of a morgue. Institutions make bank while prop traders follow, and private investors stand outside the fence wondering what’s up. If there is something I learned and decided this summer, it’s that I don’t ever want to be an equity fund manager. If I knew the chances of me outperforming the market is so slim, why do I even bother? Finance is tough and unpredictable. But economics is fun. It’s simple, it’s intuitive, it’s manipulable. This is why economists can get more attention by talking (think Paul Krugman, 郎咸平, etc.), because they don’t have to perform. They just have to talk. I mean really what’s the secret formula here for global fame? Get some very legit credentials (e.g. win the Nobel Prize in Economics), and then say some very controversial stuff (e.g. China is screwing over the US). Maybe hire 10 analysts to get you economic data to support your claims. Save the world while you’re at it. So back to the topic here… gap year. I turned down the attractive offer and decided to “explore,” and rather than just taking a semester off and graduate on time, I decided to graduate a year later. It was not an easy decision, for me or for my parents. I’ll explain this part in Chinese: “休学”这两个字在中国家长的耳中似乎象征着某种不祥的物质。这因该是因为大部分在中国世界里休学的人都是在非自愿地情况下休学：分数低到不及格了，病倒需要动大手术了，心里因为某种原因受刺激了，等等。凡休学者，定没好事儿。 可是如果休学是为了在走出校门之前更清楚的知道自己的兴趣呢？了解什么样的工作最适合自己呢？尝试这辈子都不会再尝试的事情呢？ 有没有家长为子女想过，在我们每天于校门内外奔波，与试卷课题武斗，为功名利禄所奴用，马不停蹄地为了在他人的眼中活的更高等，更高尚的时候，我们的自我呢？如果全天下有亿万件可做的事情，那在我们闭上眼睛的那一刻时我们都各自做了多少件呢？的确， 有时我们沿着主流社会走，可以走得很高，很远，可以改变世界。但现实是大部分人都不会走到那一天。大部分人在沿着现实走的时候会看到前面的路并不通往改变世界的大门，而是一个普普通通的骨灰盒。 休学。做自己想做的事情。 当你违背父母意愿走出第一步的时候，你的包袱就已经比前一步的时候要重得多。休得好了，父母可以认为你本就可以做好，不需要休学。休得不好了，父母可以将一切错误怪罪与休学这一重大的错误决定。 但是人不应该为了任何一个非主流的决策而后悔。因为主流的决策根本不是难事。当你做出了一个非主流的决策时，你是真正的做了决策了。你冒险了。你他妈男人了。 这几个星期，我去了青海，丽江，杭州，深圳，香港，武汉，最后会到北京。我看了（我眼中）最现代的，最原始的，最昂贵的，最便宜的，中国。我会到了五花八门的人，跟每一个人都想取经，了解他们在做什么，为什么做这个。 我知道在这一年之后，我会更清楚自己站在什么地方，该做什么事情。 到时，不会有任何遗憾，任何眷恋，任何责怪。因为我做了。 [caption id=”attachment_137” align=”aligncenter” width=”717” caption=”The ever-changing landscape of Qinghai”][/caption]]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[A few minutes ago, I officially announced the change in leadership for the GCC Network and the move of dividing up the Network Management Division and Network Expansion Division. As Aaron said, there is something intriguing about the fact that the NMD is the only division in GCC that has been handed off to a third Director since GCC was first founded. The first sign of “longevity” - even if only relative in comparison to the other divisions or student groups - is a sign of inner stability. Building GCC was very much like building a company. The management structure has morphed from a strict division of responsibilities, to a more organic entity, back to a very well-defined system of individual divisions. Like an entrepreneurial firm, the structure needed to adapt constantly to the environment - timing, location, people. If this sounds familiar it’s because it is the familiar “天時，地利，人和” trinity, the circumstances that will determine the success or failure of any entity. Just as instrumental music became popular in Europe when the technology of making musical instruments flourished, GCC grew and prospered drastically as China became the outlier of economic performance, exceeding expectations and creating exceptions. We have tapped into the biggest shift of paradigm in the 21st century in so many different ways it’s impossible to foresee what will be the exact outcome. But in an environment where too many factors are changing and too many uncertainties lay ahead, the best thing to do is to follow your instinct - and the worst thing to do is to stay stationary. 自古亂世出英雄 - if you only live once, which I assume we all do, why not make something special of your life? The exposure to the outside world through GCC has profoundly altered my interpretation of risk versus uncertainty. We are all risk-averse. But we cannot avoid uncertainty no matter what we do. Risk and uncertainty both exist as pure consequences of time, but risk can be calculated, modeled, and predicted; uncertainty however, is inevitable and must be embraced. The realization of the inevitability of uncertainty is the single most fundamental factor that changed much of my decision making process, and consequently, yielded the following decision: I am going to take a semester off and spend it in China. The decision is almost risk-free. But the decision is ridden with uncertainty. I have come to realize that while I am extremely risk-averse, I am not averse to uncertainty.]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[亚布力到纽约 - Chinese Entrepreneurs Forum]]></title>
      <url>%2F2010%2F04%2F14%2Fyabuli-forum-to-nyc%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[A few of us attended the “亚布力到纽约” portion of the Chinese Entrepreneur Forum - the platform involving some of the largest business titans of China today and of the world tomorrow. Upon entering the Morgan Library, the lobby was filled with familiar faces - the New York network of China-fans is probably smaller than we had anticipated. The Chinese Economy 毛振华, 冯伦, 曹德旺, 任志强, 陈东升 etc., spoke on various topics relating to one of GCC’s core focuses - China’s economy. 冯伦, President of 万通地产, and a well-known author of some very interesting books on business in China, spoke about the “five views” that are in dialogue regarding China’s political future, ranging from liberalism to absolute Maoism. The predominant view, he says, is the middle-of-the-road “new” thought - slow but reasonable reforms in the government, maintaining peace and prosperity of the country as a whole. Undoubtedly, the view is supported by both large businesses as well as the Chinese government, and probably also preferred by us students who wish to pursue future career opportunities in China . It is more true in China than anywhere else in the world that business success is highly tied to government policies. Feng observed that the most successful firms in China are ironically along the lines of government policy: the ones that are heavily regulated, and the ones that are not regulated at all. For me, this seems to refer to monopolies such as utilities and telecommunications, as well as the unknown districts of gambling, coal mining, and real estate (until last year). Feng also touched on the fact that Chinese firms are now beginning to care about corporate image, environmental impacts, and social responsibilities. Chines firms are starting to put together additional pages in their annual reports focusing on sustainable dev and corporate responsibility. This should be good news enough for those of us taking classes with Jeffrey Sachs. Other panelists emphasized that NGOs has yet to witness their Golden Age in China. With more people who are understanding the impacts of global trade, production, and consumption, there will be both more interest and more room for people to join NGOs to create impact in China. Interested in joining an NGO to work in China in the future? Now is probably the time. Finance in China 陈东升, President and CEO of 泰康人寿, also left me deep impressions about the future of business in China. 泰康人寿 was founded in 1996, but is now the 4th largest insurance companies in China. Recently, the firm took 550 employees to the Great Pyramids of Giza for both entertainment as well as their annual firm-wide summit - yes, I can relate because I was just there about a month ago. Confirming with what the GCC delegation learned during the Winter Delegation, 混业经营 (Mixed Operation: the practice of merging banking, securities, insurance, and other forms of financial services together for synergetic outcomes) is still a big focus of the Chinese financial services world. On the insurance side, though the traditional models of insurance agents that were introduced to China via 友邦 of Taiwan (which originated from Japan), new practices such as selling insurance plans via commercial banks, selling by phone, online, etc., are all on the rise. 泰康 claims to be selling 100 life insurance plans per day. A Pleasant Surprise In the sea of passionate China-lovers who were eagerly networking between panels, I bumped into someone who is perhaps more famous than all of the prominent Chinese entrepreneurs in the room combined - 哈佛女孩儿－刘亦婷. [caption id=”attachment_122” align=”aligncenter” width=”300” caption=”哈佛女孩儿－刘亦婷”][/caption] Fantastic isn’t it? If you are Chinese and you are currently in a top American college, you know who she is. Sitting next to her during the speeches, I easily forgot that this “Harvard girl” whose fame swept across China as someone who has successfully made it into Harvard from Chengdu, China, is almost ten years my elder. Time flew by and her image as a 18-year-old Harvard girl remained in our memory, but the now-experienced finance professional moved onto better things. After a summer internship at Morgan Stanely followed by several years at BCG, Yiting LIu is now on her path to be an entrepreneur and create something on her own. It’s in our blood - entrepreneurship. The phrase that “every Chinese wants to be an entrepreneur” was never an overstatement.]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[Buying the iPad]]></title>
      <url>%2F2010%2F04%2F13%2Fbuying-the-ipad%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[[caption id=”” align=”alignnone” width=”562” caption=”iBooks - not Kindle&#39;s replacement, but may kill your desire of ever buying one.”][/caption] So I decided on a whim that getting an iPad for my dad would make him a very happy father. While there is no question about the validity of my presumption, my purchase of the iPad has come under attack, scrutiny, mockery, and other forms of insult. The most unexpected of these exchanges, and possibly one of the more intellectually engaging ones, took place with strangers on the Facebook wall of a mutual friend: (Context: a high school pupil of mine updated his status to say that “iPhones are about to get alot better” - probably referring to the OS4 coming out. This stirred some dismissal of Apple’s OS in general for the iPhone. Someone then commented that “iPads are about to continue to be useless,” which then ignited a series of attack on the iPad: can’t multitask, expensive, useless, cash-cow for Apple, bigger iPhone, what’s Steve Jobs thinking, etc. etc. etc. As a proud new owner of the iPad, I stepped in to express my opinions because, well, it’s a free country last time I checked. The names of the people are taken out for confidentiality purposes.) Me: The speed of the ipad amazes me. It’s going to sell not because it’s “apple”, but because apple offers a chain of services, incorporating the product into a system that has many “subscribers” already. People who are anti-ipad are usually also anti-iPhone, anti-mac, and anti-apple in general. Without using a mac or iPhone, u just cannot experience the connectivity and universality of apple products first hand. I’ve synced my boss’s blackberry before, and I’ve spent hours on the phone with customer reps dealing with various hardware and software issues, and my conclusion is that apple has found a system to attract and to keep, and those who are outside will have to refrain from ever trying apple if they desire to remain outside forever. Sun at12:59am · Albert: As an owner of an iPod, and someone seriously considering getting an iPhone, I disagree. I appreciate that apple offers a spoonfed oppurtunity to be connected, and would have nothing against them if they didn’t charge an arm and a leg for items that have the same capabilities, but are slightly easier to use. But to each their own, and if people are willing to pay more for the same thing, so be it. I admit that all of their products are well designed, but the iPad is really bloody useless, and an abuse of their fanbase if you ask me. Get an iPhone for less, its the same, but a cellphone too. Bob: As a person who has worked on a Mac, have had a hackint0sh, own (and absolutely love) an iPod Touch, had a Windows Mobile phone, an iPhone, and currently a BlackBerry, I claim unbiasedness and politely (and completely) disagree. There’s a sea of people on the internets that are the biggest mac fanboys - who also think that Apple is just milking the idiots.The “speed” you mention comes from a 1GHz processor (pretty paltry), which is specifically designed to perform and do exactly what Apple wants and specifies. This is why Apple is terrible - complete lack of open-sourceness in order to make things “just work”. What do customers do to combat that? Jailbreak. Now that JB and Apple’s so called “multi-task” is being released for the iPad, I can only see that the iPad will struggle with it’s 1GHz A4 lamesauce processor. And by the way, I do experience the “universal+connectivity” of Apple products every day - when I sync my iPod on my PC. It’s great, but why does iTunes have to struggle on a 3.8GHz i7 processor? Why does Apple such terrible developers? WHYY? TL;DR: Apple is fucking evil. We all know it. Bob: Edit: Better pic:http://ragecomic.appspot.com/packs/misc/images/WhyWithHands.png Sun at 1:18amCharles: yea i agree with albert, the ipod touch and iphone are way better compared to ipads. plus it fits into your pocket! :Di’m a regular commuter and i rather have something portable and mobility-friendly for the same functions as iphone or touch. and since i already have a laptop that i always carry to school, i guess i dont need it lolbut ipod touch or iphone i’ll take it :D Me: The problem is not one of “need” but one of “convenience” - no one needs the iPad - it’s a device that did not exist in the market before. What it will bring to the table is a new way of completing tasks, new way of tracking information, new way of sharing and networking - and even doing new things that were not done before.For Albert and Bob - for the sake of this dialogue, have you guys gotten your hands on an iPad? If yes, do you find that it’s just as fast as your iPhone? Slightly faster? Or significantly faster?If you have not played with an iPad before, then I think this dialogue might be less meaningful. I initially rejected it as a “big iPhone” and was not going to waste my money on it. However, once I stepped got my hands on it, it was immediately clear to me that this thing was worth investing in if you intend to stay on top of the mobile technology world.You might also find this article helpful: http://mobile.venturebeat.com/2010/04/09/review-why-the-ipad-and-iphone-os-4-will-give-apple-a-knock-out-hit/ As a comment from the VentureBeat-Mobile Beat article puts best: “The iPad is not a phone replacement, it is not a laptop replacement, it is not a portable gaming device replacement, it is not a portable DVD replacement, it is not a Kindle replacement (Kindle has a 10 day not 10 hour batter life, for example. It is also much lighter), etc. It is an entirely new personal device that has a place. I can’t tell you exactly what it is, but I can feel it. This is not enough to be an effective relayer of word-of-mouth. I bought my iPad as a personal indulgence and a desire to feel the future in my hands. That’s not mass market motivation.” Albert: I would rather not pay $500 dollars for a convenience I did not need until this monstrosity was conceived. You’re only strengthening the argument that Apple is milking its fans by creating new niches that shouldn’t have been created in the first place. Bottom line - a Netbook is more functional, a cellphone is more portable and almost as functional (though, if you look at the HTC HD2 for example, it out-specs the iPad, LOL, so one can assume that gasp user created content /gasp will allow cellphones to match the iPad in functionality), and it doesn’t support flash.I’ll end with a quote from that link:“But you have to think of this device as something like a MacBook Air. That, too, is missing a lot of functional things that other laptops have, but it is so thin and cool that people who buy it, and pay more money for it than a regular laptop, don’t seem to care.”Lol MacBook Air. I concede that it seems really cool, and is probably really awesome to use at first, but it has just absolutely terrible value for the amount of money you are putting in, and the novelty will wear off shortly. And say I was to invent the iTurd, an amazing new device that fills the niche between a laptop and a desktop (requires an AC power source at all times, too big to fit in a convenient case, but small enough to carry around the house to a new location easily), so that its almost portable, but not really. It comes with the processing power of a laptop (the lowest common denominator in this situation), a price tag of a souped up desktop (the highest common denominator), and is very aesthetically pleasing with some very cool, unique user friendly functions that grab your attention but are intrinsically flawed in that a desktop would do them better. Would you get it? P.S. Expect this in two years if Apple keeps with their current business strategy (invent niche, fill niche). Bob: If you are happy with it, that’s great David. Canadian’s haven’t had the opportunity to play with it yet - I’m looking forward to visiting the Apple store soon. “PC fanboys” (I use this term VERY loosely) have rejected the iPad for one single reason: it doesn’t do anything exceedingly well, although the price point says it should, especially for what you physically get. However, you’re right. No one needs an iPad, but no one should judge what a person can or can’t buy. The way I see it, the iPad is a toy. If you need to do serious work, what are you going to choose - a mouse and keyboard or a touchscreen keyboard with no tactile feedback? If you’re outside and want to watch a video or play music, what are you going to use - an iPhone or an iPad? IF you want to play some games or use some over-the-top (aka useless) apps, I guess I’d use an iPad. This new tablet niche won’t die. It’s a great concept, and it shows the amazing steps we have taken in technology over the years. The point I’m trying to make, however, is that Apple stepped forward with a product that lacks the software and hardware to take full advantage of this tablet niche, while charging an exorbitant amount. Let’s wait for the Google tablet (actually coming), shall we? Apple will always be Apple - if that’s a synonym for being assholes.http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/08/apples-iphone-lockdown-apps-must-be-written-in-one-of-three-la/ My last comment: Bob - very much appreciate your comment. I completely agree that the iPad is a toy - but it creates the possibility beyond what traditional gaming consoles can do. With the iPad, I can imagine classes being remotely taught, house lights/sound/windows/curtains/TVs being remotely controlled, meetings being held (with an external camera), presentations being made, and more that I have not thought of. If someone wants to tell me that you can do all of the above with some sort of software on a PC netbook - forget it. Niche softwares on PCs are glitchy enough that no one will devote the energy and time into making amazing softwares that will make the users happy with it. It will also probably cost a million bucks for something like that. I owned a netbook once - I hated it because the screen was too small, the keyboard was too small, the trackpad was too small, and it was also heavy for its size. The possibility of coming home from school, taking out a device, turn on various parts of the room, turn on the clock app when going to bed, and set alarm for the next day; wake up, take device to school, read the news on the bus, take notes in class, draw pictures, record class lectures, and come home with homework assignments entered automatically from school’s server - this is the kind of combo beyond that of a netbook or a mobile phone. I do not disagree the Google might be able to come up with something better - in fact I am very much looking forward to it as well. Competition is a positive trait of free market economy, and filling niches as a strategy is nothing wrong as well. Albert - You mentioned that “Apple is milking its fans by creating new niches that shouldn’t have been created in the first place.” So what do you say about Microsoft? Sony? Nintendo? Or online farming games? I do not understand the concept of a niche that should not have been created. Innovation drives the world forward, unless you’re developing weapons. So I just wanted to hear what are your opinions here. I might just be a blind consumer who’s trying to justify my impromptu decision. Let’s not focus on the tech spec too much here - ultimately, none of us are computer engineers or product managers with the knowledge base to debate the merit of the iPad’s intrinsic (endogenous) value. Rather, I think we should focus on the American consumer culture - who are going to buy the iPads, who will like it, how has Apple successfully marketed itself? [caption id=”” align=”alignright” width=”432” caption=”Steve Jobs with Apple&#39;s new game-changer.”][/caption] Ultimately though, I am of course not going to regret my decision because after all, I am bringing the iPad to China. Consumer culture is completely different over there. Products derive value not based on their usefulness, but almost solely on their desirability. Desirability is in turn determined by numerous exogenous factors such as word-of-mouth, foreignness, or lack of supply (the Chinese golden rule of “物以稀為貴”). As someone on Venture Beat comments: “The iPad is not a phone replacement, it is not a laptop replacement, it is not a portable gaming device replacement, it is not a portable DVD replacement, it is not a Kindle replacement (Kindle has a 10 day not 10 hour batter life, for example. It is also much lighter), etc. It is an entirely new personal device that has a place. I can’t tell you exactly what it is, but I can feel it. This is not enough to be an effective relayer of word-of-mouth. I bought my iPad as a personal indulgence and a desire to feel the future in my hands. That’s not mass market motivation. For most people, the iPad is simply unjustifiable. Kids may nag their parents for it (or not), but the parents will push back. It’s too damn expensive and it isn’t a clear upgrade for anything. Who (besides developers and fools like me) can justify it? Still, it’s one of the most satisfying consumer purchases I’ve ever made and I drink in the envy everywhere I go. I am so cool I don’t even need a refrigerator for my beer.” Meet the iPad - a new gadget for developers, fools, and the Chinese.]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[The Marginal Utility of Job Function]]></title>
      <url>%2F2010%2F04%2F01%2Fthe-marginal-utility-of-job-function%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[A thought popped up my mind while I was in Topics of Money and Finance. John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern explained decision making by using expect utility theory in 1944. A large part of the foundation of their idea lies in the utility function - an alternative way of understanding value of goods in the market after scholars abandoned the Labor Theory of Value favored by Classical and Marxian economists. In essence, the little sticky price tags on the myriad goods in supermarkets depended no on how much it costs to make the goods, but rather on how “happy” consumers are by purchasing them. I suppose this explains why there are so many differentiated products on the market from a demand perspective. Sure, for the supplier, the enterprise is engaging in competitive behavior and opening up new markets by offering differentiated products. However, from a pure consumer perspective, perhaps all we wanted was variety, for the simple reason that our marginal utility on each “new” differentiated product is higher than the marginal utility on a second unit of any product that we already consume. (I certainly felt this way when I made a point of buying a different flavor of vitamin water every time until I have tried all of them - yes, I probably fell for their marketing tricks, but so have a lot of people I’m sure.) This leads to my next supposition. What if one can gain more utility by performing different job functions? Suppose you start with network management. You become familiar with the process of managing chapters and keeping correspondence, but the more you do it the less utility you generate by performing the job function. Eventually you become tired of managing chapters and want to try something new. You then move to communications and begin dealing with speakers and invited guests to various events. Similarly, you begin with a high utility but gradually declines as time goes on. In some ways the utility function would be similar to the learning curve - except the learning curve doesn’t measure how “happy” you are. And happiness matters significantly more in a non-salary-paying world. But the other side of the story is that you are specializing whenever you spend longer time performing the same task. So there must be a trade-off between utility and value of specialization. In the real world, companies reward specialization by increasing the wage or salary. In a NPO where specialization is not measured by the amount of salary paid, how do we make sure everyone is happy doing the same job over an extended period of time? Each division therefore must figure out ways to reward specialization. Sure, promotion certainly serves as a huge incentive, even in the real world. But the nature of promotion implies that there will be some who are not promoted. For them, their utility must be supplemented, if not sustained, by both tangible and intangible rewards for specializing. A lot of this clearly is not all that well-thoughtout, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know!]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[Happy Birthday David!]]></title>
      <url>%2F2010%2F03%2F09%2Fhappy-birthday-david%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[I turn 21 today. How do I feel about it? To be perfectly honest. Nothing much. I can’t grasp if I am simply feeling jaded about the social life of Planet College, or I am just too busy now to take my time to organize Party with the Zhukeeper__ III. No. It can’t be the latter. I was just as busy in freshman year, when I went to meetings from 7-10pm on consecutive weekdays, gave tours at the Visitors Center, socialized like I had never seen humans before, and performed at every possible event - I was just as busy as I am right now. I don’t feel so jaded either - I still enjoy every minute here, executing every action with passion. But I did not pause my cramming session for Jeffrey Sachs’ Challenges of Sustainable Development class to write down my newfound nonchalance toward birthdays. I am here up at 2am because I have received some “new” happy birthday wishes, a category of birthday wishes that did not exist until this year - wishes from friends that are friends at a different capacity than ever before; wishes from the network. It is not uncommon that individuals develop a sense of emotional accomplishment within the GCC network and find the need to put them in words. However, getting there (and speaking from experience) can be very tough. Associates on the Network Management Division have come and gone. There are of course exogenous reasons beyond our control. But chapter advisory is not a job for just anyone. Many have complained the lack of a sense of “accomplishment” and “progress.” Tangible outcomes. The connection between efforts and rewards. The key aspect of an enjoyable job (or in this case, extracurricular activity). Management is building solutions for a relationship-based problem. It is communicating effectively and understanding the needs of the other person at the other end of the line while proposing solutions in a way that will make “everyone” happy. It is the creation of Pareto efficiency in the realm of P2P communications. Some examples: When a chapter does not follow through with promises, what do we do? Cut is not always the right answer. They may have done extremely well in the past. A chapter cannot communicate with the advisor assigned effectively. What should I do? We cannot always just reassign - there may not be enough associates to take on more chapters. I am struck by fifteen mid-terms in two days and must be MIA for an extended period of time. I let something slip through the cracks. What do I do as supervisor? “I apologize for getting this back to you so late…” But why not a quick exchange on gchat? “Hey, how you doin? I’m really sorry there’s been fifteen midterms …”You are probably thinking: Are e-mail and gchat really that different? Yes - they are. There are a million decisions that need to be made in every communication. Have you ever found yourself in these positions: What’s form of communication should you use? Text, chat, phone, voice mail, video, or just e-mail? What’s the tone you want to use? What format in the e-mail? Where to bold, italicize, underline? What level of mitigated speech should you use? How to use it? Are you sure you are using it correctly? Should you doubt your phrases? Should you let the receiver know that you’re doubting yourself? What sort of response would you prompt? How might that affect the overarching goal of this communication? Have you double-checked your e-mail? Did you forget an attachment? Did you remember to CC someone? Are you thinking too much about all of this? Some of these decisions seem minor and probably will not matter in the grand scheme of things. But I am here to argue that they do. Non-physical communication eliminates all possibilities of physical language, which supposedly encompasses 60-70% of human communications. In the world of cyber communication, you are not a person - you are words, fonts, colors, tone, voice, and maybe 1 billion pictures on Facebook if the other person really cared. Therefore, the considerations listed above determine the success of the communications, and the communications determine the success of the ultimate outcome. I really appreciate the “new” birthday wishes (even one from Toulouse, France [special shout-out to Marianna for a wonderful e-card!]), because they come from those that I have communicated with successfully. And because of the success of these communications, I found a balance between effort and reward. Reaching the landmark age of 21 may not mean as much to me on a cultural or social level as it it assumed to for the vast majority of American college students. But the “new” birthday wishes I have received give me a new sense of purpose. The story of my running of the network is a story of how to create Pareto efficiency in organization - using words.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Mr. Ronnie Chan of Hang Lung Properties Ltd. recently published an article at the Financial Times. The title is rather catchy - “The west’s preaching to the east must stop” - a title filled with patriotism and a hint of annoyance. A talk last Thursday night focused predominantly on the content of this article. In essence, Mr. Chan argues for five of what he calls “global rebalancing” between East and West: a rebalancing of moral authority a shift in decision-making power in global economic affairs a shift in the centre of economic gravity from the Atlantic to the Pacific a movement away from a total dependence on the US dollar as the global trading currency a movement to a more balanced and stable worldIn his speech delivered to a group of around thirty at the Citi Executive Conference Center, Ronnie surprised me as someone that is not only successful in business, but also extremely bold and intelligent. His article sounds great to Asian ears - who doesn’t like to hear that your side of the world is triumphing while the old “winner” is now on the “losing” side? On the issue of morality, Mr. Chan wrote, “Now some in America are advocating a G2 with only the US and China. If the focus shifts to the G2 to make decisions, then what happens to democracy? The west has a moral dilemma.” On the fourth issue, Mr. Chan wrote, “Over time some countries will keep more renminbi, making it more like a reserve currency.” Some how I’m not so hot on this one. Unless “over time” means “over decades.” Still, I don’t believe it - probably because the economists teaching my econ classes at Columbia don’t believe it. But more on the event. The reason why I say that Mr. Chan is bold is that he is very pragmatic in my view. Use the EU for example - “People argued for days about restructuring the EU… but I said, the rest of the world doesn’t give a damn.” I have always thought that perhaps I do not “feel” much for the EU because I do not live there - but I guess I’m wrong. It’s a global phenomenon. People just don’t care. It’s like Canada. On the topic of Japan, Mr. Chan also stated that in a nation with a decreasing population size (i.e. a decreasing work force), the “economic growth model” becomes an “economic maintenance model” - and a negative growth rate should no longer be seen as a “recession.” But uh… why don’t we just look at per capita growth instead? This one is also interesting - “The word ‘Chineseness’ and ‘nationalism’ are oxymorons“ - the logic within which is too deep for my ESL brain. Perhaps someone else can enlighten me as to what Mr. Chan really meant. But from what I gathered, he is basically saying that the Chinese do not actually understand what “nationalism” means - that it was always triggered by something else. But I wasn’t sure. Toward the end of the Q&amp;A session, Mr. Chan touched on the Asia Business Conference because a lady in the crowd asked whether or not he was attending as he is one of the founders. Mr. Chan said, “we don’t invite outside people to come and talk as much… we listen and learn from one another.” Indeed a very unconventional idea. Maybe I’ll incorporate part of this for GCC Day.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[As prize for winning the Columbia Case Challenge, Team Almost GS was given the opportunity to have lunch with Mr. Becker Chase from Booz &amp; Co.’s New York office. The lunch was great. Sashimi, bento box, shabu shabu - all paid for by the generous Columbia Economics Society (which receives its funding from our student life fee). Turns out, Booz is very interested in China. Their home page tells the compelling story of a new “China Strategy” - a worthwhile read. “In the world’s fastest-growing economy, the experience of the last ten years will not be the best guide to the next ten years. Business leaders around the world who want to be successful—not just in China, but anywhere—will need a new China strategy.” Indeed, a lot of this might just seem like an overly not-another-bullish-view-on-China book. But the fact that the Chairman of Booz &amp; Co. Greater China region is thinking in line with GCC should still be taken as an encouragement. And what do you know? “Indeed, China is now the world’s largest and fastest-growing source of entrepreneurial start-ups.” Spot-on opportunity for GCC members right there. The world’s largest international student network focusing on China - and what business opportunities do our members have, if not in entrepreneurial endeavors? GCC-Vanderbilt is looking at starting a chapter initiative on doing pro bono consulting work in Nashville Tennessee. GCC-Harvard is looking at bringing volunteerism to China. “Since 1978, China’s economic growth has been phenomenal,” the report goes on, “but also extremely inefficient.” With regards to the model of business ownership, the chairman writes, “it will evolve toward a nondemocratic but market-driven form of rule that, arguably, has never been seen on the worldstage before.” Included is a fascinating interactive graphic of how these ownership trends are heading toward. Lastly, Mr. Tse wrote on leadership - “Many Chinese officials have internalized this aspiration. They have taken on responsibilities beyond their job descriptions, acting as the guiding hand in the creation of a world-leading nation. Their interests extend beyond self-enrichment to the creation of national wealth.” This reminds me of the words of Mr. Li at Ping An Insurance during the GCC Winter Delegation, “The most outstanding human capital of China are going into the political system.” So all of this sounds wonderful and great. How do I get a piece of it? Becker assured me that every year, Booz tries to hire at least one person from Columbia. How very kind of them. I think I am better off working my ass off at Goldman Sachs this summer.]]></content>

Should I go? I wasn’t sure. I don’t even have a team. I thought.9:20a.m.Walked into Satow Room of Lerner in boots, jeans, and t-shirt. Lots of people - well, more than I had expected - all in suits.I was placed on a team. Then I was switched. Within 5 minutes I was switched again - Too many teams were missing people, and in the end it made more sense for me to be add onto a team that had a group of 3 rather than staying in a group that only had 2.I met Damion and Mansur for the first time. Katherine and I spoke for the first time after we have been through 5 econ electives together. I was the youngest on the team, and I liked it.10:00a.m.I changed into my routine charcoal suit and glasses. Damion’s energy level awakened my spirits. BLT and green tea by my laptop. I was ready to go.10:40a.m.The case began. Microfinance? I jot down notes as I speed-read through the packet. Where should I begin? The case was very different from Corporate Finance. No financial statements. Just a bunch of projections and statistics of competitors. Where do we begin?11:15a.m.We finished reading the case. It took too long. I was getting worried about our progress.“I’m going to go ahead an put some basic info into the PowerPoint.” Having done multiple successful presentations before, I was confident with this aspect of the presentation.The team decided the three main challenges facing the firm: fraud, profitability, growth.12:00p.m.The team debated at length regarding the possibility of introducing technology to help cutting down overhead costs and the possibility of fraud. I glanced at the profit forecasts. No way, I said, microfinance is a volume business, with a profit margin of less than a hundredth of a percent - if we want the firm to turn profitable in 3 years, technology would suck in all the profits. I was firm. A vote confirmed my position.12:30p.m.Debate ensued on the possibility of raising labor wages. I did not want to do anything that would increase costs. How about we change the model and collect interests via banks rather than in small groups? It worked out well. Everyone agreed.1:00p.m.Time is going fast. We broke down individual recommendations into 4 sections, with each one of the team members in charge of certain calculations, in hope that we would put them all together at the end. We squeezed a lunch break in there somewhere. I sat in the same place with the unfinished BLT.2:00p.m.Time was going faster than we expected. Our recommendations were smart, but our calculations were very basic. We had no pro forma. This is not gonna go so well, I thought.We had 40 minutes left. “Let’s start building the PowerPoint,” a teammate suggested. I did my usual trick - overview, projection, recommendations. Having seen a good number of presentations before, I knew simplicity was key, and audience members usually appreciate animations.2:40p.m.Productivity shot up 5x within the last ten minutes. Procrastination is part of human nature.We walked into the dark room. Inside, a judge sat with a notepad and a copy of the case next to him. Projector faced a whiteboard that had poor surface. Here we go. I thought.I opened the presentation with an overview and outlined some of the things that I felt were important. My teammates each went in depth regarding the recommendations that we made and reasoning behind each. It was a quick ten-minutes. The judge stopped us in the middle of our presentation and asked, “why lend only to women?” We gave a satisfactory answer. “Because women statistically save more and are better borrowers because they are more likely to make repayment.”3:00p.m.The team ambled to the piano lounge. How did we do? I did not think too much about it. I do not like overestimation, nor do I like making guesses if the answer will be revealed in the next ten minutes. The team talked about how to answer some of the questions that the judge threw at us at the end. How are we going to solve the problem of hiring talent and retain them?“Look!” A teammate shouted. The firm that was in the case existed in real life. We felt dumb for not having noticed before. But wait - the website confirmed that all of our recommendations were accurate. How could that be? The coincidence (or I should say, our group acumen) gave me a boost of confidence.3:10p.m.The finalists were announced. We made it. I was surprised - I had expected much harsher competition from the other team members, many of whom I knew from other student organizations. No time to think about that for now. Let’s get on with editing the PowerPoint.3:30p.m.The team practiced the presentation twice. We were going last. It meant that we had more time, but no chance of seeing the other presentations. We decided to add in a new slide to address the “talent” issue brought up by]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[New year celebrations continued in Chinese communities throughout the world. A record number of Chinese tourists visited Taiwan over the Lunar New Year. A total of about 40,000 Chinese tourists are expected this year, three times more than the number of tourists for the same season last year - according to the US-China Institute at the University of Southern California.I remember when I was an analyst at Phillip Securities doing research, one place I looked at was the Taiwan hotel industry. Tourist hotel occupancy rate was expected to rise to 74.6% in 2009 from 64.7% in 2008 because of positive cross-Strait sentiment and policy deregulation. One concern was that report cited that the Won depreciated sharply against the yen, causing more Japanese tourists to pick Korea over Taiwan. However, if we can show that the RMB will appreciate significantly against the NT$ (likely), then tourists will also be more likely to pick Taiwan as a travel destination.Not included in the report was a key cultural trend between China and Taiwan – that Taiwan entertainment industry has a significant influence over Chinese pop culture – hence, deregulation will result in more travelers to Taiwan – even if they do not end up staying for days in hotels.Interestingly, this week Japan surpassed China as the largest holder of U.S. Treasury securities. The U.S. Treasury Department reported that China trimmed its U.S. debt holdings by $34.2 billion in December. To date, Japan holds $768.8 billion of U.S. Treasury securities while mainland China holds $755.4 billion worth of it.On the sports front, China is doing much better than I expected (probably because I never paid attention to China’s winter sports development) at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. China won gold and silver in figure skating. Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo became the first ever non-European couple to win the gold medal in the Olympic pairs figure skating event. From what I understand, that was China`s first gold in figure skating history of Winter Olympic Games. But with a little bit of both Chinese and Canadian pride, I was very surprised to learn that China won Bronze medal in curling - a sport originally invented in Britain. But unsurprisingly, the Chinese team was coached by someone from Montreal - fier d’être canadien!]]></content>
